Welcome to This Week in Hololive! This is a new website that's focused on
keeping up with interesting things happening every week with all of the Hololive
talents. There's a lot of content to love and not everybody has time to keep up
with it all, so let us try to keep you in the loop!

Here's what you can expect to start happening here over the next couple months:

* **HoloDay and Weekly Roundups** &mdash; I'm going to have small bursts of
information coming out on a very frequent basis as interesting things happen
with all of the talents. Those will be HoloDay posts. The Weekly Roundups are
designed as an "In Case You Missed It" drop of information from the HoloDays for
the past week + some additional information on talent milestones, some
interesting content you might have missed, and some of my favorite fan art from
the past week. Soon, you'll be able to subscribe to our Weekly Roundups via
email to make sure you never miss an update.
* **HoloHistory Series** &mdash; I'm gonna take a look back at some of the
history of Hololive and the various talents, particularly Gen 0 - 3, so that you
can learn more about them all.
* **HoloMusic Series** &mdash; I **LOVE** the musical talent within Hololive. It
is by far some of my favorite content and we will be give special attention to
both past and future original music as well as covers that come from the
Hololive talents.
* **HoloArt Corner** &mdash; Hololive boasts one of the most talented and
creative fanbases I've personally ever seen and I want to take some time on a
regular basis to highlight fanworks that have been created to honor the talents.

I hope that you stick around and enjoy! Check out our Twitter at the link at the
bottom of each page and please share our articles with your friends who may be
new to the rabbit hole!
