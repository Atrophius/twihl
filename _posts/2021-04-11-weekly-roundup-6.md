Welcome to This Week in Hololive's Weekly Roundup where we attempt to summarize
a lot of the interesting happenings of the last week. This week was a big week
for milestones as well as anniversaries. We also closed out the week with an
incredible concert from AZKi. Here we go!

## Our Latest Articles

Almost every day, I post HoloDay articles recapping interesting things that
happened in the last couple days. We have **four** HoloDays this week.
Definitely go check these out for anything you might have missed this week!

* [HoloDay #15][HoloDay15] - Calli's EP is topping charts and a new week means a new episode of Holo no Graffiti. Let's check it out!
* [HoloDay #16][HoloDay16] - Shion sings to 700k, it's Okayu's 2 year debut anniversary, and we're also celebrating the anniversary of the HoloID branch!

In addition to HoloDays, we also have three other ongoing articles series:
**The HoloArt Corner**, **HoloHistory**, and **HoloMusic**. The HoloArt Corner
is a series dedicated to featuring the amazing artistic works of fans and
members of the Hololive community. HoloHistory is a look back into the origins
and early days of our favorite idols. HoloMusic is a deeper look into some of
our favorite music from the various members of Hololive.

A-chan!

back on Suisei's early days and her very first original song, Comet.
* [HoloMusic #1][HoloMusic1] - On the inaugural edition of "HoloMusic", we're
taking a deep look at Towa's new MV for her first original song: Palette.

## AZKi's 7th Live "Stand at the Crossroads"

**Wow.** Just ... wow. I'll admit that I actually had kind of high expectations
for this event, but AZKi is a real pro. I was thoroughly impressed with
everything from the virtual venue setup, the camera work, the setlist and the
way the event was structured ... everything.

**First thing's first**: if you want to watch this event for free, you need to
do so during the next week. The archive is going to remain up and public on
AZKi's channel for one week before going members-only. It's completely free for
one week, so make sure you check out the entire concert soon! With that out of
the way, I want to take a bit to talk about what happened and how impressive it
all was.

This was a fully online, virtual event that presumably took place inside of the
Hololive studio. Instead of using one of the standard Hololive idol stage setups
these events normally take place on, AZKi produced a special virtual venue that
is modeled after the real life venue in Akihabara where she held her first ever
concert, "The Shitest Start". This gave the entire event a much more intimate
feel than the standard big virtual stage / audience setup like the kind that was
used during her special performance back in the 72 hour "Don't Stop the Music"
festival.

The concert started with AMOKA as an opening act. AMOKA is a vsinger group that
is mostly known for doing concerts inside of VRChat. They performed three songs:

1. Not completely exist
2. 7 layer train
3. Find yours

After AMOKA wrapped up, we got a transition over to AZKi's apperance on stage
that was a bit too epic for its own good. AZKi opened her set with "FEEL ALIVE"
which is a song produced by DJ Fox for last year's 48 hour music festival. The
first several songs from AZKi's set are all poppy EDM bangers, with FEEL ALIVE a
standout that is very reminiscient of well-known EDM artists like Zed or
similar.

She transitioned into some more hard rock songs including "Fake.Fake.Fake" which
has some very metal percussion going on underneath some rock guitar with hints
of orchestral strings here and there. This is the part where I have to note for
the folks who aren't that familiar with AZKi: The amount of genre diversity that
she plays with throughout her library of original music is legitimately
impressive.

We also got several ballad style songs and some pick ups from the hololive IDOL
PROJECT with a couple performances of songs like Asuiro Clear Sky, Dreaming
Days, and Kirameki Rider. She even blessed us with an extended encore with four
additional songs after the main event concluded, including what appeared to be
a recording of AZKi in her original model performing her very first original
song, Creating World.

I am personally a sucker for Inochi, which is probably AZKi's most well-known
song, but it's that way for a reason. The song is incredible and her performance
of it today was outstanding. I've embedded the concert archive below starting
at Inochi, but ***please*** watch the entire thing. AZKi is incredible and this
concert will only be available to the public for one week.

## Haachama World Wide Tour Guide Project Complete

The WWS Haato team in collaboration with MASS released their Haachama World Tour
Guide video and companion site today! The team behind this project compiled fan
photo submissions from all of the world in order to give Haachama a virtual
world tour and to let her know that she's not alone on her journey.

In addtion to the art and pictures included in the video, there's also a website
that displays all of the supportive messages that Haatons submitted while
Haachama was away. You can
[click here to take a look at the website](https://haatotabi.tk/home) and their
tour guide video is embedded below. Definitely give it a watch, it's an amazing
display of Haatons' love for their #1 idol.

## Risu's Debut Anniversary

Risu celebrated her debut anniversary yesterday by
[reacting to her debut stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGlgrZwnLIk). She
had a bit of a hard time holding back her cringing, but I think we can all
relate to cringing at things we've done in the past. In addition to the debut
reaction, she also did an
[a capella karaoke stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekYTWAQo4Mk) as part
of her celebrations.

And to top off what was a lovely Risu-filled day, she also released this English
cover of Watame's Lullaby that I have embedded below:

{% include yt_embed.html video="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55Q3ygt88Yw" %}

## Moona's Debut Anniversary

Moona the professional memer baited her fans with a stream thumbnail that had a
huge "3D Very Special Stream" on it that had small text that made the "3D" into
"365 Days". You can find the original thumbnail below, as it's since been
replaced on the archived video:

{% include image.html name="moona_meme.png" %}

Having successfully bamboozled her fans and being thoroughly proud of herself,
Moona opened her stream in a total giggle fit at the joke and then proceeded to
do a re-debut with some singing at the end. I've embedded her stream at her
performance of the Japanese version of the new HoloID group original song
"id:entity voices" so go check it out:

## Coco's Meme Review with Mel

This week's meme review guest was Yozora Mel! Mel has been aptly described by
Reddit as an "adorable cinnamon roll" who is sickeningly sweet and doesn't get
near enough attention. We also got a declaration from Mel that Coco _is also_ an
adorable cinnamon roll, so that's canon now. And yes, she said the thing. Go
check it out below:

## Gura's Sponsored "BanG Dream! Girls Band Party" Stream

Everybody's favorite rhythm gaming shark got sponsored to do a stream of the 
"BanG Dream! Girls Band Party" mobile gacha game. She even got her own special
"Gawr Boost Drink" in-game as a login reward. Gura describes it as "freshly
squeezed shark juice" which is ... a little disturbing to think about, if I'm
being completely honest. Check out her stream below:

{% include yt_embed.html video="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdjM4ND53IM" %}

## Calli Lyric Dives Her EP

As part of Calli's ongoing celebration following the launch of her latest EP,
she did a stream where she took a deep dive into the lyrics from all the songs
on her album. This stream is a really interesting look inside Calli's
songwriting process and the way she interprets the meaning behind each song. It
also included an awesome tangent around the tarot cards which appeared in the
"Red" MV after chat asked about them.

I've embedded her lyric dive video below at her explanation of the tarot cards
from the "Red" MV. It includes some bonus Takamori てえてえ with Calli's
explanation of Kiara as the Sun card.

Here's a few of my favorite fan arts from the past week or so. I've embedded the
original tweets for all of these below. Go show these artists some love.

## Talent Milestones

As is tradition now, we're gonna end with some notable milestones that were hit
in the last week:

* Nakiri Ayame - 800k Subscribers
* Murasaki Shion - 700k Subscribers
* Kanade Izuru - 100k Subscribers
* Mori Calliope - 1.25M Subscribers
* Takanashi Kiara - 900k Subscribers
* AZKi - 400k Subscribers

A bit of a meme milestone, but Sora's teddy bear Ankimo has his own YouTube
channel which reached 10k Subscribers this week. In a recent stream, Sora
laughed about people celebrating Ankimo's milestone and asked why people were
subscribing to a channel that would never be updated again.

* Ankimo - 10k Subscribers

## Closing Thoughts

AZKi's concert was a wonderful way to close out such a great week. And we've
got even more musical goodness coming up with Suisei's concert on Tuesday! Hope
you're ready for that. Our standard HoloDay coverage resumes tomorrow!
