<abbr title="Sui-chan wa~ Kyou mo Kawaii~!! (Sui-chan is~ also cute today~!!)">すいちゃんは～ 今日もかわい～！！</abbr>

Welcome back to another HoloDay! [Yesterday was the Weekly Roundup][RoundUp2],
so go check that out if you missed it. Today begins a new week and is a little
special because it's Suisei's birthday + 3rd Debut Anniversary! We've also got
a new HoloGra episode, AZKi's solo live archive from the weekend, and Aqua's
solo Apex Master grind. Let's go!

## HAPPY BIRTHDAY SUISEI!

Suisei held her birthday/anniversary stream this morning where she did call-ins
with some of the other HoloMembers. She opened the stream by singing Houki
Boushi (Bleach ED3) and then took calls from Miko, Lamy, Aki, Rushia, Choco,
Sora, and Flare.

There were a lot of cute and funny moments during the call-ins. As an example,
Suisei asked each member for a love confession at the end of each call and Flare
hit her with the UNO reverse card to get Suisei to confess to her instead. Then
denied Suisei's confession with "Sorry, I already have Noel" and hung up.

Suisei also announced her upcoming 4th 3D Live event happening on April 13th at
2100 JST (that's 8 am EDT, fellow overseas bros). Suisei's 3rd Live was pretty
legendary for a lot of reasons, including its production quality and the guests
that showed up to perform with Sui-chan. I'm super excited to see what she has
in store for us this time.

On a more serious note, Suisei gave us an update on the situation with her
health. After consulting with her doctor, it was determined that the way she
speaks on stream needed to change as the voice she was using was too stressful
on her throat. Sui-chan worried a lot about what people would think of her and
was really nervous, but the viewers seemed largely in support of her. It wasn't
super clear from the live translation during the stream if this will also result
in any major changes to her singing voice over time, so that remains to be seen.
Either way, I think I can speak for most Hoshiyomis when I say that the most
important thing to all of us is Sui-chan's health because we want to support her
and enjoy her music for years to come.

I've embedded Suisei's stream below, so be sure to check it out:

Over on [Ina's drawing stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbxbpkLIf4E) for
this week, she also was celebrating Suisei's birthday with a drawing. You can
see the completed drawing below:

## New HoloGra featuring Towa

A new week means a new episode of Holo no Graffiti, Hololive's weekly animation
series starring the girls. The localization team for HoloGra is excellent and
all of the episodes are captioned, so be sure to check out the others you may
have missed. I've embedded this week's episode below:

## Marshmallow for Suisei's Rushia Collab

Suisei is having a collab with Rushia this weekend and will be answering
questions from Marshmallow together with her. She also said she's looking
forward to fanart of the two of them together. Check out Suisei's tweet below:

## AZKi's Solo Live Archive

I mentioned during [yesterday's roundup][RoundUp2] that AZKi's Solo Live from
her "Don't Stop the Music" festival would be getting uploaded and that archive
is now available on her channel. AZKi celebrated many fellow VSingers during her
performance, including HoloMembers Watame and Sora with renditions of their
originals "Ai-Mai Chocolate" and "Fure Fure Love". She also performed "Asurio
ClearSky" from the Hololive IDOL PROJECT, which I've used as the start time for
the embed below:

## Aqua's Apex Master Grind

Aqua has been on an Apex grind for a while now as she is going for Master rank
playing solo. She got really close this Split, making it to Diamond 1 before
sadly slipping back into Diamond 2. Her stream yesterday got a lot of attention
as she streamed for 11 hours and had a whopping 1M views when she ended the
stream.

Today was unfortunately not her day as she made one last attempt to rank up
before the split soft reset tomorrow, but the stream ended after only a couple
hours of play. Good luck next split, Aqutan! You're very close!

Sui-chan. Really looking forward to April 13th for the celebration!
