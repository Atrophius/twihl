Welcome to This Week in Hololive's Weekly Roundup where we attempt to summarize
a lot of the interesting happenings of the last week. This past week saw a lot
of interesting Hololive activity including Yukoku Roberu's 3D Debut, several
of the talents breaking Reddit, Anya's birthday, and more! Let's get right to
it!

## This Week's HoloDays

Almost every day, I post HoloDay articles recapping interesting things that
happened in the last couple days. We have five HoloDays from the last week that
I've linked below so that you can go check them out:

* [HoloDay #1][HoloDay1] - Roberu's 3D debut announcement and IoSoRadio 3.
* [HoloDay #2][HoloDay2] - Haachama Day!
* [HoloDay #3][HoloDay3] - Suisei does a mini Full Metal Alchemist themed
karaoke stream, Noel and Flare join (break?) Reddit, and Roboco's 3rd
Anniversary + Short Break.
* [HoloDay #4][HoloDay4] - V-Carnival tickets are now on sale! We've got new
music videos from Flare, AZKi, and Calli. And Subaru is re-uploading archives of
her original Undertale run.
* [HoloDay #5][HoloDay5] - It's Anya's birthday! Some new Anya merch is
available, Shion has a new cover, and I'm gonna gush about Towa a bit because
she gave us another brilliant karaoke stream with a little something special at
the end.

## HoloEN 6-Month Anniversary

Hololive English celebrated their 6-Month anniversary this week with a Don't
Starve Together collab that included a character mod pack allowing them to play
as themselves. This was a really fun stream and the mod pack gave each girl
an interesting set of abilities and equipment like Ina being able to call out
her tentacles, both Ina and Gura being able to swim while the others couldn't,
Kiara got a resurrection ability that set her surroundings on fire, Amelia had
access to her dog Bubba that was a portable container, and Calli had her
signature scythe and was also immortal.

The girls also announced some commemorative merch to go along with their
anniversary, including mascot keychains, acrylic stands of each member, and a
really cute set of mascot plushies that were designed by Ina herself! In
addition to the merch, a soundtrack of instrumentals that are themed after each
member of the group was released to all streaming platforms. I've embedded the
merch announcement and the soundtrack preview video below:

## Suisei Health Update

Suisei has been having ongoing issues with her throat for some time now. Seeing
as she has two live performances coming up, she decided to go visit a doctor to
get checked out. A combination of issues, including seasonal allergies, seem to
be causing her some trouble and she's going to be trying to take it easy for
some time in order to heal. This means she'll be limiting the types of things
she can do on stream to things that will not strain her throat too much and her
upcoming birthday/debut anniversary celebration stream will be a normal stream,
either a call-in or a chatting stream.

**Special note to Hoshiyomis**: Suisei is taking care of herself and has her
manager for support. Please don't feel the need to try to tell her what to do or
how to take care of herself. She is getting the help she needs. Just be patient
while she heals and support her in what she's able to do in the meantime.

## Coco's Meme Review Returns with Luna

After a couple weeks off due to not enough usable memes, Coco is back with a new
episode of her meme review. This week's guest was Luna! They covered a lot of
hilarious content provided by Reddit and Luna got to learn some new things,
like the meaning of "yeet" and ... uhh ... something of Watame's that Coco wants
to see. Check it out below:

## Kiara's HoloTalk Returns with Mel

Now that Kiara has settled in after her move, we have the return of her regular
talk show where she introduces primarily Hololive JP talents to the English
speaking audience by interviewing them and live-translating. This week's
HoloTalk guest was the adorable banpire Yozora Mel. Check out the stream below:

## Last Call for Bloom

We're in the final days of Bloom's archive availability. If you want to purchase
tickets to watch the concert before it goes away, you have until March 17th! The
archive will also become unavailable after 23:59:59 JST that day, so this will
be your last chance to see the show until the Blu-ray release later this year.

Tickets are available [over at the Bloom website][BloomTickets].

## Towa and Matsuri in Crazy Raccoon Cup #4

Towa and Matsuri both played on teams in the Crazy Raccoon Cup #4 Apex Legends
tournament. The girls have been grinding the game lately and Towa was doing
scrims on stream every day for a bit leading up to the event. The structure of
the tournament took professional players and paired them up with VTubers and
other content creators and our girls teams both did pretty well. Towa's group
secured two wins in a row and Matsuri's group picked up one.

Towa's group finished in a tie for 2nd place and Matsuri's group finished in
4th. You can see the details and results [over on liquidpedia][LPCRC].

## HoloArt Corner Roundup Edition

Here's a few of my favorite fan arts from the past week or so. I've embedded the
original tweets for all of these below. Go show these artists some love.
