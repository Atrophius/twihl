<abbr title="Mogu Mogu~ Okayu! (Okayu's Greeting)">もぐもぐ～おかゆ！</abbr>

Welcome to another HoloDay! Today we're looking at Okayu's 2nd debut
anniversary, Shion's endurance karaoke to 700k subs, and HoloID had a big day
celebrating the 1 year anniversary of the Indonesian branch of Hololive with a
brand new original song and a karaoke relay!

Also, [this week's HoloNews issue for March 29 - April 4 is now available][HoloNews]!
Go check that out over on Reddit to catch up on recent collabs, playthroughs,
and some stories I didn't have a chance to cover here. Let's get into it!

## HoloID's 1 Year Anniversary

Hololive's Indonesian branch turns 1 year old this month with the 1st Gen HoloID
girls all celebrating their individual debut anniversaries next week. As part
of the celebrations, all six of the girls joined together on a new original song
called "id:entity voices"! The song is being released in both Indonesian and
Japanese and I've embedded the MV for the Indonesian version below. The MV has
caption translations for both languages as well as English and the captions are
color coded to which girl(s) are singing which parts. I just want to give a
quick special mention to both Ollie and Anya who sound _great_ on this track.

In addtion to the new original, the girls also did a karaoke relay event where
everyone streamed a small karaoke set back to back. Below are the links to all
the streams as well as a setlist for what everyone sang. Also at the bottom of
this section I'm going to highlight a few performances that I was particularly
fond of. I've become quite a fan of AZKi and I **love** Inochi. Moona's
performance of it today was so good that it almost brought out some tears. Check
them all out below:

## Okayu's 2 Year Debut Anniversary

On this day, two years ago, Okayu started blessing this world with her lovely
voice and unique outlook on life and gaming. As one of the chillest members of
Hololive with one of the most mesmerising voices, Okayu is a talent that I've
grown to love quite a lot since falling into the rabbit hole. It's always fun
watching her play some of the most frustrating games imaginable while still
seeming to enjoy herself and not really ever rage.

Okayu also has quite a lovely singing voice which she put on display with
today's anniversary stream. I've embedded it below at her performance of "flos"
which is one of my favorite covers that she's done.

In addition to lovely singing, we also have new anniversary merch available! For
a limited time, you can score some or all of the following Okayu-related items
designed by Okayu's illustrator Kamioka Chiroru:

* Large acrylic stand
* Okayu mini plush toy
* Escaped Onigiriya Badge

## Shion's Endurance Karaoke

Shion had an endurance karaoke stream to 700k subs this morning and sang a
variety of different things. The stream was a little over 2 hours long and was a
lot of fun to listen to. I'll be embedding the stream below at Shion's rendition
of Fuwa Fuwa Time:

## Wrapping Up

Tomorrow's a big day because of the full 1st Gen collab that's happening over on
