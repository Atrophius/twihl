Welcome to the first HoloMusic! This is going to be a very occasional series of
articles where we take a close look at music or musicians that come out of
Hololive. [Join the discussion over on Reddit][RedditDiscuss].

This morning, [I wrote HoloDay #7][HoloDay7] which included the release of
Towa's new MV for Palette. I can't get it out of my head. I want to talk more
about it and I've been wondering what to kick off the "HoloMusic" article series
with, so I think this is kind of the perfect beginning.

_I've embedded the MV for Palette above, in case you haven't seen it yet. Make
sure to turn captions on because the lyrics have been translated into English._

When Palette debuted during Bloom and we found out that Towa herself wrote the
lyrics for the song, I kind of put two and two together and figured that it
would probably be a sort of musical representation of her journey up to now and
looking to the future with what she wanted to accomplish. The symbolism of a
"painter's palette" is pretty strong with having the ability to paint your own
picture, for example. I've only been studying Japanese for a couple months now
so my own personal knowledge of the language is exceptionally limited, though I
was able to tease out a few details from the lyrics using what little I know.

My suspicions on the meaningfulness of the song were basically confirmed later
on when [a post emerged on the Hololive subreddit][RedditLyrics] with a
fan-provided translation and interpretation of the lyrics. It seemed very much
like what Towa was writing about was the difference between the "monochrome"
feeling of her life before she found the dream that she now pursues and the
color that has been introduced by her efforts to make that dream a reality.

But now, we have an official translation included in the captions of the video
itself that we can reference. The story feels about the same, but the imagery in
the video give it all much more emotion and impact.

{% include image.html name="palette-frame-2.png" %}

Starting immediately from the first frames of the video, we can see a few things
that are notable. The colors from the very beginning and throughout most of the
video feature a very monochromatic hue. Any real color that shows up is muted
and most things are in grayscale. We open with a shot of a set of notebooks, one
of which is open to a picture of Sora. An old picture of Sora. The outfit in
this image is one of Sora's early designs. The shadow of a hand above the
notebook represents Towa reaching for the same dream that she sees Sora chasing.
Sora is _the_ Hololive idol and Towa also wants to be seen as an idol.

Then we see the first view of the key art and logo for the track. There's color
in the world and background around Towa, but she's very much still in the
monochromatic hue representing the early stages of her journey.

> Nobody sees what it is blowing in the wind in this world  
> It is all monochrome, impossible to tell black from white  
> Thought I try to paint it up, all the colors never take hold  
> I don't even feel alive, stuck in the middle of this all

We open with a shot of a starry sky that zooms in on what appears to be a blurry
view of Bibi (it's a little hard to tell, but his eye color matches Bibi's). In
Towa's lore, Bibi is Towa's pet and a guardian/protector that was given to her
by her mother. Bibi can hold multiple forms, one we'll see later in the video,
but most notably he is most often seen in the form of Towa's signature hat.

The next several scenes are of a visibily unsatisfied Towa. She's tried to
"paint up" her monochrome world, but none of the colors ever take hold. She
feels stuck and lifeless, not entirely sure of how to move forward.

> I've had enough  
> I have a goal I want to reach though it is far  
> But this is my world, and I want to hold it dear with all my feelings  
> On the canvas of my dreams I will continue to remain  
> To see what's burning in my heart play out, my own story

In the first part of the song, Towa seems reluctant to push forward. She has a
goal that she recognizes is far away, but she feels constrained by the
circumstances of her world and wants to hang on to this world with all her
feelings. But continuing to paint with the same colors will result in all
pictures looking the same. The canvas of her dreams where she seeks to remain
is symbollically represented by the picture of her younger self cracking open
and spilling forth a massive amount of liquid that she then becomes submerged
in.

> While a silver platter is so well and truly meaningless  
> I stand scared of losing the pieces of the puzzle I have  
> But then the freezing night finally begins to thaw  
> And reaches out to me with a new dawn

As Towa sinks deeper, we see a couple more images from her youth. Encouragement
from what looks like a father figure ("Kenzoku" is written on the wrist, which
stands for "family"). A look at a younger Towa who also is in love with singing.
And while she's been given an opportunity that looks like success on a silver
platter, she doesn't want to lose herself and the parts of her that make up
who she is and has been up to now.

> That is enough
> I have a goal I want to reach though it is far  
> I will accept it all and hold it dear together with all my tears  
> On the canvas of my dreams, what truly gives it all meaning  
> Is freely painting on the skies above my own story

As Towa starts to lose consciousness, Bibi appears to save her and lead her back
to safety. Recognizing Bibi, where he comes from, and what he represents, Towa
realizes that in order to truly pursue the goal and dreams that she has, she has
to accept everything and hold it all dear. She realizes that what truly gives
life meaning is being the artist of your own story and rather than holding onto
the past, she has to look forward to the future.

Bibi shows her what she can be and who she can become and this is represented in
one of the most powerful shots in the entire MV with that behind the back shot
of Towa in her standard outfit.

> And so the freezing night finally begins to thaw  
> And reaches out to me with a new dawn

And so, Towa steps forward with determination. There's still a little
uncertainty in her face, but the willpower is there and she will face whatever
comes next with a firey passion.

> This is enough  
> I have a goal I want to reach though it is far  
> And this is my world, it is wrapped up together with all my words  
> On the canvas of my dreams, which I will continue to paint  
> In the same colors burning within my heart now  
> It may be all too weak and frail  
> It may even crumble and fail  
> My mind's desire still takes flight toward all eternity  
> It will resonate with and dye the future in my own palette

This part of the MV is incredible due to the major infusion of color on the drop
following a very emotionally charged set of vocals from Towa. The lyrics in the
chorus change very subtly over the course of the song from "I've had enough" to
"That is enough" and finally "This is enough" showing her journey from
frustration through realization and finally acceptance of who she is and what
she wants to become.

She asserts that she will now paint on the canvas of her dreams using the colors
of the passion burning deep inside her heart, acknowledging that while it may
be possible that her dream could ultimately fail her desire is still to fly
toward that goal with everything she has and dye that future in the colors of
her new palette.

I love the last couple shots in this section because they're an obvious callback
to her 3D debut and the smile there was recreated for the photo, only this time
in her idol outfit. Talk about a smile you want to protect with everything you
have ...

The MV closes with another look at that set of Hololive related notebooks, but
this time the picture inside is of Towa. This symbolizes that she's where she
wants to be, alongside her personal idol in Sora and her friends and colleagues
within Hololive. She's on her journey to be an idol, just like the others.

## Wrapping Up

I really love this song. And this video. And Towa. The passion and emotion that
she puts into her singing is infectious and inspiring and this video is a
perfect representation of that. It's about as perfect of a MV for as perfect of
a first original you could possibly ask for. I know that I personally will be
looking forward to everything Towa does in the future, because I know she's
gonna rock it. Good luck, Towa.
