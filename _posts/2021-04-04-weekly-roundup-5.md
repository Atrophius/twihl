Welcome to This Week in Hololive's Weekly Roundup where we attempt to summarize
a lot of the interesting happenings of the last week. This week was crazy with
Coco's 1M Subscribers celebration, Haachama's return, a Gura + Matsuri cover
collab, Flare and Calli both celebrating birthdays, Calli's new EP, and more!
Let's go!

## Our Latest Articles

Almost every day, I post HoloDay articles recapping interesting things that
happened in the last couple days. We have **four** HoloDays this week and it has
been a crazy packed week. Definitely go check these out for anything you might
have missed this week!

* [HoloDay #11][HoloDay11] - It's a karaoke party, Coco celebrated 1M
Subscribers, this week's HoloGra is out, and HAACHAMA IS COMING BACK!
* [HoloDay #12][HoloDay12] - Gura and Matsuri team up on a cover of Sorairo
Days, Rikka and Calli collab and do some (amazing!) singing, and Haachama brings
us the finale of the Haachama lore series ... or is it?
* [HoloDay #13][HoloDay13] - It's April Fool's Day and everyone's up to
something. What's real and what's fake? Honestly, who knows at this point.
* [HoloDay #14][HoloDay14] - Happy Friday! We're finishing up the rest of our
April Fool's coverage as well as talking about the OkaKoro anniversary stream,
some recent musical streams, Sora's new membership emotes, and it's FLARE'S
BIRTHDAY TODAY!

In addition to HoloDays, we also have three other ongoing articles series:
**The HoloArt Corner**, **HoloHistory**, and **HoloMusic**. The HoloArt Corner
is a series dedicated to featuring the amazing artistic works of fans and
members of the Hololive community. HoloHistory is a look back into the origins
and early days of our favorite idols. HoloMusic is a deeper look into some of
our favorite music from the various members of Hololive.

* [HoloArt Corner #3][HoloArt3] - Week 3 of the HoloArt Corner features Fan Art
of Miko, Risu, Haato, Aki, Lamy, Flare, Ina, Gura, Calli, Suisei, Ayame, and
A-chan!
* [HoloHistory #1][HoloHistory1] - We're kicking off HoloHistory with a look
back on Suisei's early days and her very first original song, Comet.
* [HoloMusic #1][HoloMusic1] - On the inaugural edition of "HoloMusic", we're
taking a deep look at Towa's new MV for her first original song: Palette.

## Calli's EP "Your Mori." is OUT NOW

Calli's new EP is out now on all streaming services and physical copies have
started shipping for people who pre-ordered. You can still get a physical copy
(which includes an exclusive bonus song not available for streaming) on sites
like Amazon Japan and CDJapan if you're interested in ordering.

Calli released a new MV for the song "Red" off the EP which I have embedded
below. Also check out the "New Music" section at the bottom of the article for
quick links to the official YouTube Music streams for all of the songs. I
personally recommend guh quite a lot. That song and Red are my two favorites
from the EP, at the moment.

## HAPPY BIRTHDAY CALLI!

It's also Calli's birthday today! She held a fun celebration stream that doubled
as a launch party for her new EP. The last half of the stream was a call-in
session which included calls from Watame, Kiara, Amelia, Ina, Rikka, Reine,
Ollie, Korone, and a surprise call from A-chan! The stream is embedded below so
you can go check it out:

Calli also announced her commemorative birthday merch which includes some pretty
crazy stuff. Take a look at this list:

* Calli's new EP "Your Mori." on vinyl
* A large EP art poster that Calli described as being "as tall as a short dude"
* Special Calli dakimakura (body pillow) cover
* Set of 3 badges, including Ina's death-sensei mascot design
* Commemorative birthday voice pack

As you can probably imagine with a merch set this stacked, the full package is a
bit expensive and will run you a cool 14,444 JPY which comes out to about $130
USD. You can order Calli's birthday merch
[here on Booth for Japanese shipping][CalliBoothMerch] or
[here on GeekJack for overseas shipping][CalliGJMerch].

## V-Carnival Was Incredible

I talked about V-Carnival tickets going on sale back in [HoloDay #4][HoloDay4]
and then actually forgot that the event was happening in the chaos of the last
couple weeks of stuff happening. The event was **this weekend** and the
[archives are still available until April 18th][VCarnTickets]. I will openly
admit that I was a little skeptical about this event because of the price tag.
Now that I've seen it, I will say in no uncertain terms: ***It was worth it.***

The entire event was done using AR technology that puts all of the performers
on the real life stage in the venue similar to the final performances on each
day of Hololive's Beyond the Stage concert from the end of last year. Only they
built an entire event out of it. The production quality on everything from stage
lighting to special effects to camera work and everything in between was
probably the best I've seen from any event in this space so far.

A handful of our girls participated in the event on both days. Here's the set
list for performances that Hololive was involved in:

* Day 1: Suisei, Okayu, Korone
  * Roki - Hoshimachi Suisei + HimeHina
  * Tenkyuu (2nd Original) - Hoshimachi Suisei
  * Next Color Planet (3rd Original) - Hoshimachi Suisei
  * Umiyuri Kaiteitan - Nekomata Okayu
  * Bomber King Theme - Inugame Korone
  * Hyadain's Amazing Friendship - Inugame Korone + Nekomata Okayu
* Day 2: Sora, Watame, Mio, Fubuki
  * Genesis of Aquarion - Tokino Sora + Fuji Aoi
  * ERROR - Tokoyami Towa
  * Palette - Tokoyami Towa
  * Melancholic  - Tsunomaki Watame
  * Ai-Mai Chocolate - Tsunomaki Watame
  * Sparkle - Ookami Mio
  * STARDUST SONG - Ookami Mio + Shirakami Fubuki
  * Butter-fly - Shirakami Fubuki
  * Say! Fanfare - Shirakami Fubuki
  * Alien Alien - Tokino Sora
  * Guruguru Love Story - Tokino Sora
  * Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari - All Day 2 Members

Suisei single-handedly makes Day 1 worth the watch. Her performance on Roki with
HimeHina was fantastic and then her solos were incredible as well. She sounds
great. But if that doesn't sell you, Okayu and Korone were _absolutely adorable_
during their respective sections.

Day 2 was **stacked**, though. Hololive dominated this day with several
performances from some heavy hitters. Towa's performances of ERROR and Palette
were both amazing and very much worth checking out, but I want to talk about how
Sora absolutely killed all of her performances today. Her duet with Aoi on
Genesis of Aquarion is a highlight of the entire event and it was _the opener_
for Day 2. Her vocal range on Alien Alien is frankly unbelievable and if I
hadn't already heard her sing it live previously I probably wouldn't believe it.
Pairing that with the dancing she was doing at the same time plus her
performance of Guruguru Love Story which is always a really fun song and it's
really no wonder why she's Hololive's brightest star.

But the surprising stand out on Day 2 for me was Miosha. I love Towa and she's
my second favorite vocalist inside of Hololive right now, but Mio's performance
of Sparkle on this stage was something else. I can't really explain how much I
love Mio's official cover of this song and the stage effects, lightning,
everything was just absolutely gorgeous when she came out. I seriously almost
teared up from the very first note. It was beautiful. The instrumental
arrangement they used for her performance was epic, as well. If you still need a
little boost to help you fall in love with Mio, this is definitely the thing to
see.

But don't take my word for it. Seriously,
[go see it for yourself][VCarnTickets]. I love Suisei. She's my favorite
performer in all of Hololive, but I would actually recommend you pick Day 2 if
you can only buy one day. Mio's performance was my favorite from the entire
weekend and the rest of Day 2 is just so ridiculously stacked.

## Kiara's HoloTalk with Guest Aki Rosenthal

Kiara hosted another episode of HoloTalk this week, this time with special guest
Aki Rosenthal from Hololive 1st Generation. Aki is a total sweetheart and gave
extremely thoughtful answers to so many of Kiara's questions. She also has
experienced quite a lot from being one of the earliest Hololive talents and
seen her share of ups and downs. This interview was almost definitely the best
episode of HoloTalk to date. I've embedded it below, so be sure to check it out:

## Coco's Meme Review with ... YAGOO?

Coco's back with another meme review and this week's guest was ... YAGOO?! Or,
at least, as close an approximation to him as Coco could manage. Coco put
together a YAGOO soundboard that she used as her "guest" during this week's meme
review. Coco is entertaining, as always, and toward the end there was a special
guest "Friend" who showed up! Go check it out:

## HoloNews on Tuesday!

Every week, the team over at HoloNews releases a new issue of their fanzine
covering the news of the previous week over on Reddit. It's beautifully designed
and they report on a lot of things I'm not able to cover here, including
interesting collabs and playthroughs as well as some stories I haven't had time
to cover. I'll be linking the news in Tuesday's HoloDay, so be on the lookout
for that.

## Closing Thoughts

This week was absolutely packed to the brim with all kinds of fun stuff. There's
no way I could cover absolutely everything, so be on the lookout for this week's
HoloNews issue on Tuesday to help fill in some of the gaps! Our normal HoloDay
coverage will resume tomorrow. Also, fanart and clips will pick back up again
next week as well.
