<abbr title="Konyappi! (Towa's Greeting)">こんやっぴ！</abbr>

It's time for another HoloDay! Today in #4, we're talking music, music, music.
We also cover Subaru's original Undertale run with a brief look at her history
and why it's being re-uploaded. I'm also going to start sharing a few of my
recent favorite clips in each post. Read to the end because there's a big
website update that went live today ... Let's go!

## V-Carnival

We've got another new live event that some of the girls are participating in.
This time, it's [V-Carnival][VCarni]. This event promises to deliver an event in
a live space unlike anything that has been seen before using cutting edge CG and
AR technology.

This event is being hyped up a pretty good amount and my top three favorite
HoloVocalists are performing, so it's definitely got me interested. The
unfortunate part is that the price tag is a little steep. It's a 2-day event
with each day being 7,900 yen (~$72 USD) so if you want to watch both days, that
will be 15,800 yen (~$145 USD). Just for comparison, Hololive's Beyond the Stage
and Bloom concerts were only 6,000 yen (~$55 USD) each day.

I imagine the tech involved is what's making the ticket prices so expensive, but
I also expect that would be a hard price for a lot of people unfamiliar with the
event to stomach. There will also be other VTubers besides just the Hololive
girls performing there. Here's the details on which of our girls will be
performing on each day and tickets can be purchased at the link above:

* Day 1: Korone, Okayu, Suisei
* Day 2: Mio, Fubuki, Sora, Towa

## New Music Videos

### AZKi - 運命の在処

AZKi released her 2nd album [Re:Creating world][AZKiAlbum] in December of last
year. Several MVs of songs from the album have been released over the last four
months and today we have 運命の在処 which is the opening track from the album.

I admit that I haven't heard AZKi's album in its entirety and I listened to this
a few times while I was writing today's HoloDay. It's got some serious anime
OP energy. I really dig this one and it'll be going into my main HoloSongs
playlist. Give it a listen below.

### Flare - KING

Ah, KING. This song is basically a collectible, at this point. I feel like close
to half of the talents have covered this song now, but I haven't actually
counted.

Flare's rendition is great, as expected. She really is a talented vocalist and
one that I'm falling more in love with every time I hear her sing. If you
haven't been present for a Flare karaoke stream or listened to any of the other
tracks she features on, I'd highly recommend checking those out. And if you're
not tired of this particular song yet, you'll definitely want to check it out
below.

And here's some bonus NoeFure
<abbr title="Teetee - Wholesome/Adorable">てえてえ</abbr> for you:

### Calli - Ibasho

Calli's sponsored collaboration with Princess Connect! Re: Dive gifted us a new
track since music is her forte. This song was already
[previously released on the Crunchyroll Collection YouTube][IbashoMV] (you 
should go watch this MV, it's really good), but Calli uploaded it to her
personal channel last night and I haven't talked about it here yet, sooo ...

Calli is pretty much the beginning of all of this for me. When HoloEN debuted,
it was her music and personality that first got my attention. And I have been
constantly and consistently impressed with the range of her musical talent since
the day I first saw her. Ibasho is no exception. And, if anything, this song
gets me even more hyped for the full version of the
[Hololive Alternative MV][HoloALTMV] where she's doing the vocals.

I love Calli's rapping, but I think she seriously undervalues her singing voice.
And I love seeing her exploring it more in songs like these. Give it a listen
below.

## Subaru's Undertale Archives

*Back in the day* ... Hololive went through a bit of a copyright-related scare
when Mio's channel almost got struck into oblivion. This led to an event that
could be called "The Great Archiving" where virtually ALL of the talents' videos
were privated until they could be re-reviewed for copyright safety. Cover also
started getting more serious about making sure the talents have explicit
permission to stream the games they play. A lot of those old privated videos
still haven't been made public to this day.

Subaru was a bit of a special case, though. Apparently, Subaru's manager
overreacted and made the mistake of outright ***deleting*** Subaru's videos
rather than just making them private. Which resulted in the vast majority of
them being unrecoverable.

With Hololive having explicit permission to play Undertale and Deltarune, and
Subaru having recently completed a G-route run alongside several of her peers,
it looks like she was also able to recover archives of her previous Undertale
run from "The Great Archiving" and has started uploading them to her channel.
You can find the first video in the series below:

## Check out these clips

Here's a few fun clips that I enjoyed recently. If you're looking for more
clips, head on over to [our resources page][TWIHLResources] where you can find
a list of quality clippers. I've also started tagging some of these with the
talents that they commonly clip and will be filling out these tags more over
time.
