HoloDay #2 is here and it's Haachama Day, so I wanted to take a look back over
what's been going on with her just in case you missed it.

## On Break for Now

There's nothing new from Haachama very recently as she is currently
["on a journey to find herself"][HaatoTweet] following the abrupt end of the
Haachama lore series of videos she had been doing. It was sad news for Haatons
who had been following the story closely since mid-January when Haachama started
the Haato/Haachama lore exposition, but it was probably even more devastating to
Haachama herself who had put so much effort into this content.

Haachama seemed to indicate that new rules have been put in place that would've
made the ending to the Haachama lore series difficult and she decided to also
private most of the series of videos as a result. Coco seemed to corroborate the
rule change in a recent stream, as well.

Beyond that, specifics on the situation are sparse and since it's not something
that Cover is likely to comment on directly, there's not much additional info
beyond rampant speculation which I won't get into here.

## Haachama Lore Recap

For the people who missed it, the Haachama Lore journey was a fascinating
descent into the darkness and horror that is the "Haato/Haachama" duality of
her character. Haachama did an exceptional job of playing up psychological
horror themes with each passing week and left all of her fans in a constant,
simultaneous state of confusion, horror, and intrigue.

Haachama's lore exposition was a major driving force in her final sprint to
one million subscribers on YouTube, as her videos were getting a ton of extra
attention because of the level of detail and effort she put into each one. All
the way back to the very beginning, even the smallest details like the titles of
the songs in an early unarchived karaoke stream seemingly had meaning.

A user on the [Reddit and Fan Discord](/resources) put together an excellent
set of summaries for the Haachama lore that
[you can find here](//imgur.com/a/PaJb48k). Huge thanks and credit to Boomber on
the Fan Discord for putting these summaries together.

The detail and care that Haachama put into this series along with the way she
incorporated fan works into all of the videos was really something to behold.
If you haven't had an opportunity to watch it, maybe someone will be able to
point you in the direction of where you can find them. It's definitely worth
the effort.

## Ina & Miku Day

Real quick, because I can never not talk about an Ina drawing stream ...

March 9th is Hatsune Miku day and to commemorate the occasion,
[Ina did a Miku drawing on stream today][InaDrawing]. Today's drawing stream was
also to make up for the normal Sunday drawing stream yesterday being replaced by
the finale of her Hollow Knight run, where she finally defeated The Radiance.
Here's a snap of the drawing as of the end of today's stream:

You can find the finished and signed version over on
[Ina's twitter][InaMikuTweet].

## Take Care, Haachama!

That's gonna be all for today. [Go send Haachama some love][HaatoTwitter] on
Twitter. Haatons miss you and hope you take all of the time you need to refresh
after the experience of the last couple months and come back even stronger.

Thanks for reading! Be sure to [give us a follow][TWIHLTwitter] over on Twitter
