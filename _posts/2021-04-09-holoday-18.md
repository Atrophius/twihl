Happy Friday! Welcome to the last HoloDay for this week! Today we're taking a
look at AZKi's chatting stream ahead of her concert this weekend, this morning's
big Among Us collab, Botan and Kiara on the Diablo Alpha, and Coco's special
ARK episode of meme review! Let's go!

## AZKi Gears Up for This Weekend

AZKi's 7th solo live concert, Stand at the Crossroads, is _this weekend_ and
is going to be streamed on her channel at 7 PM JST (6 AM EDT) this Sunday, April
11th. This morning, AZKi did a chatting stream where she talked a little bit
about her history and her previous events as well as did a little bit of
singing.

I am personally really hyped for this weekend. AZKi is an incredibly talented
performer and she has a ton of experience with producing these solo concerts,
with six of them under her belt already. I'm excited to see what she has in
store for her 7th live and how she plans to take it to the next level.

Check out this morning's stream below, which is embedded at her performance of
"Kirameki Rider", and make sure you catch her concert this weekend. It's
**FREE**, so there's no excuse not to! I'll be talking about the event here
during the roundup this weekend.

## Coco's Special ARK-themed Meme Review

Coco hit everyone with an extra meme review for this week, giving us the gift
of more laughs with this special ARK episode. But the other purpose of this
episode was for Coco to announce that she has created a special ARK server for
fans of Hololive to play on. If you're an ARK player and want to play with some
other Hololive fans, the server info is in the video description and the
password is in the video itself.

## Hololive Among Us

There was another multi-gen Among Us collab over on the HoloJP side this
morning. Today's session included the following players:

* [Mio][MioAU]
* [Polka][PolkaAU]
* [Subaru][SubaruAU]
* [Korone][KoroneAU]
* [Okayu][OkayuAU]
* [Rushia][RushiaAU]
* [Botan][BotanAU]
* [Luna][LunaAU]
* [Miko][MikoAU]
* [Fubuki][FubukiAU]

You'll probably start seeing several clips coming out of this session because
Among Us always tends to produce some clip-worthy moments. We already have this
funny clip of Korone (with special guest Subaru POV near the end) which I'm
going to embedded below:

## Botan and Kiara Play Diablo II: Resurrected

I'm a bit of an ARPG nerd and a huge fan of games like Path of Exile. This
started from back in the day playing Diablo and Diablo II when I was younger.
It's safe to say that I've been a bit excited about the idea of a Diablo II
remaster for a while but seeing some of my favorite Hololive talents playing the
Alpha test is like my worlds are colliding and I love it. I've embedded both
Botan and Kiara's streams below if you want to check them out.
