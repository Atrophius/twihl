Welcome to This Week in Hololive's Weekly Roundup where we attempt to summarize
a lot of the interesting happenings of the last week. This past week was
absolutely bananas with a ton of fun stuff happening that we didn't get to cover
as part of the HoloDays, including: Rikka's 3D Live, an update on Suisei's 
radio show "Music Space", new EN manager art, Coco's meme review, and a ton
more. Here we go!

## Our Latest Articles

Almost every day, I post HoloDay articles recapping interesting things that
happened in the last couple days. We only have two HoloDays this week because I
was feeling a little under the weather mid-week:

* [HoloDay #9][HoloDay9] - This week's HoloGra is out, Aqua's been on a wild
Apex grind, AZKi's solo live archive is now available, and IT'S SUISEI'S
BIRTHDAY!
* [HoloDay #10][HoloDay10] - It's officially Monster Hunter time, Calli's OMORI
freakout, the Bouquet Cover Art is adorable, and Sora's latest solo concert is
available on Blu-ray!

In addition to HoloDays, we also have three other ongoing articles series:
**The HoloArt Corner**, **HoloHistory**, and **HoloMusic**. The HoloArt Corner
is a series dedicated to featuring the amazing artistic works of fans and
members of the Hololive community. HoloHistory is a look back into the origins
and early days of our favorite idols. HoloMusic is a deeper look into some of
our favorite music from the various members of Hololive.

* [HoloArt Corner #3][HoloArt3] - Week 3 of the HoloArt Corner features Fan Art
of Miko, Risu, Haato, Aki, Lamy, Flare, Ina, Gura, Calli, Suisei, Ayame, and
A-chan!
* [HoloHistory #1][HoloHistory1] - We're kicking off HoloHistory with a look
back on Suisei's early days and her very first original song, Comet.
* [HoloMusic #1][HoloMusic1] - On the inaugural edition of "HoloMusic", we're
taking a deep look at Towa's new MV for her first original song: Palette.

## Rikka's 3D Live and New Original Songs

Rikka held a 3D Live commemoration stream for his reaching 100k Subscribers this
week. It was a mini-concert that showed off Rikka's very impressive singing
ability, but he wasn't satisfied with _just_ impressive singing. Rikka dropped
big news in the form of two new original songs, one of which is a collaboration
with everybody's favorite Rapping Reaper.

This is really big because it is the first time members from Hololive and
Holostars had collaborated on an original song. It's also the first major
collaboration between HoloEN and Holostars. I'm embedding the stream below
starting at "Spiral Tones" which is the collab with Calli. You can find the
other original "Archive" at the end of the stream, but as always I recommend
watching the full stream. The rest of the set is really good.

## Suisei's Radio Presence is Changing

This weekend is the last episode of Suisei's weekly radio show, Music Space.
The show ran for a year, ending with exactly 52 episodes.  Sadly, due to the
pandemic, quite a lot of the later episodes were re-runs due to the state of
emergency in Japan making it impossible to do in-studio shows with guests. After
the final show airs in Japan this weekend, the parts should end up on Suisei's
and the A&G channels as usual next week.

But as one door closes, another opens. It was announced this week that Suisei
would be hosting a new show with veteran voice actress Tadokoro Azuza. The new
show seems to be a chatting show where they bring together two people from
parallel worlds to talk about their respective fields and it seems they're
looking for fan questions and letters for the first broadcast.

Music Space was a program I actually listened to weekly ever since I fell in
love with Suisei's singing, so I'll be sad to see it go, but I'm looking forward
to what comes next. If you're not familiar with Music Space, I've embedded a
small sample from a recent episode below. This is Suisei singing "Shukumei" with
fellow HoloMember Minato Aqua:

## Calli Drew Her Manager

With Calli's recent drawing stream, all of the HoloEN Managers are now named and
have "canonical" designs. Calli's manager is "J-chad" and you can find her
finished design below along with some fanart from Mamaloni that I just couldn't
help but feature as well:

{% include tweet_embed.html tweet="https://twitter.com/CRUNCHY_MMLONI/status/1375770598127718409" %}

For those who may be out of the loop, this trend of naming and designing the
EN managers started back when Ina, Gura, and Amelia's manager featured on a
Left 4 Dead 2 collab where Enma filled in as their 4th. Her performance during
that collab and particularly the way she wielded a katana in-game netted her
a lot of fans, which led to Ina giving her an official name and design during
one of her weekly drawing streams:

{% include tweet_embed.html tweet="https://twitter.com/ninomaeinanis/status/1324994681973792769" %}

Kiara has a separate manager from Calli and the other girls that had been known
as "Jenma" for a little while now, but she also came up with a description for
what Jenma looks like which has been turned into fanart. KFP Employee Akkanen
doodled the first art of Jenma during the stream where Kiara first described
what she looks like and you can find that art below. The design most closely
matching Kiara's description is on the left.

All of the HoloEN managers are now included on our
[Hololive Members][HoloMembers] page which will give you easy access to their
fanart hashtags on Twitter if you want to check out more of their art!

## Main Theme of ARK: The Lost Stories Released

Toward the end of last year, the team behind "ARK: The Lost Stories" crowdfunded
an orchestral performance video for the main theme of their project. Our very
own Coco-kaichou was a major backer in bringing this to life, earning her a top
line "Executive Producer" spot alongside Venalis and Podcreature.

I'm a bit of a music nerd as you may know from the rest of the writings on this
site, but I want to tell you in no uncertain terms that this performance
absolutely rocks. I love it. The announcement tweet and the music video itself
are both embedded below. Check them out:

## Trailer for Calli's New EP Released

We're officially one week away from the release of Calli's new EP and our Reaper
Dad has blessed us with a preview. Calli uploaded an EP trailer this weekend
which I have embedded below.

I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be a fan of all these based on the preview, but I
think "guh" stands out as the one most likely to be my favorite. This plus the
new track with Rikka has me on some pretty crazy Calli hype levels.

## Hololive English Auditions Have Concluded

This week, we got the official confirmation that auditions for the next batch of
English Hololive talents has ended. We're another step closer toward a new
batch of HoloMembers and I'm super excited to see this group debut later this
year. Hololive has continuously raised the bar for their talent with each
subsequent generation, which has been incredibly clear with HoloMyth, so the new
folks are almost certain to be some of the most talented creators we will have
seen.

We don't currently have any official timeline on when the next group will be
debuting, but my personal theory is sometime around late Summer or early Fall.

## VARK's 4th Cinderella Switch Concert

VR Concert Platform "VARK" held their 4th Cinderella Switch concert with
Luna and Matsuri. The Cinderella Switch series of concerts showcases two talents
in live performances with them alternating between one of them singing on stage
with the other being "in the crowd" as a spectator with you. It's intended to
be an immersive virtual experience in VR, but they also have a standard video
version of the performances. You can find their official tweet on the event
below with pricing details and a link for tickets. The paid archive will be
available until mid-April and _may_ be uploaded to YouTube later if you don't
mind waiting. I've also embedded Watame's performance from the 3rd Cinderella
Switch below so you can see what the event is like:

## Coco's Meme Review with AZKi

This week's guest on Coco's Meme Review was AZKi! This was another great episode
and (_spoiler alert_) **she said the thing**. AZKi is a virtual diva and, up
until recently, has been more focused on music production than streaming. I've
really been enjoying seeing her stream and interact more with the other members
which is something I hope continues because she deserves way more attention
than her subscriber count would suggest.

I'm not going to spoil anything else from the episode. It's embedded below, go
enjoy it for yourself. It's great.

## HoloNews on Tuesday!

Every week, the team over at HoloNews releases a new issue of their fanzine
covering the news of the previous week over on Reddit. It's beautifully designed
and they report on a lot of things I'm not able to cover here, including
interesting collabs and playthroughs as well as some stories I haven't had time
to cover. I'll be linking the news in Tuesday's HoloDay, so be on the lookout
for that.

## New Music This Week

## Talent Milestones

As is tradition now, we're gonna end with some notable milestones that were hit
in the last week:

* Oozora Subaru - 800k Subscribers
* Kureiji Ollie - 500k Subscribers
* Kishido Temma - 60k Subscribers
* Astel Leda - 90k Subscribers

## Closing Thoughts

This week was wild and there was stuff I wasn't able to keep up with that you'll
be hearing more about on Tuesday when the HoloNews issue for this week comes
out. Our normal HoloDay coverage resumes tomorrow. I'm anticipating another
busy week!
