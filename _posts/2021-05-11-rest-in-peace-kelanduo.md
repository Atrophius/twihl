Kelanduo was a Minecraft Pixel artist most notably known for his Hololive-themed
map arts. Some people may be familiar with him from a Guiness World Record art
build he had previously done of Hololive's own Kiryu Coco that was absolutely
spectacular. Easily one of the coolest pieces of Coco art I've ever seen and the
scale and structure of the build in Minecraft is incredible.

When I read the news today that he had passed away but left behind one final
video, one final build so big that it took 11 MILLION blocks to realize, I knew
I had to check it out. Knowing that he was battling an illness that would take
his life just a few days after this video was posted combined with the
legitimately perfect music he chose to use ... the floodgates just opened. This
is just such a raw display of love toward the talents and a collection of
awe-inspiring pieces of art that it moved me to tears.

I'm embedding the video below. Please spread it far and wide. It deserves to be
seen by as many people as possible.

Rest in Peace, Kelanduo.
