Welcome to another HoloDay! Today on big #20, we're talking about best DOOG's
debut anniversary, Calli's manga read-along, new music from a couple of angels,
and more! Let's get started!

## Korone's 2nd Debut Anniversary

This week, Korone celebrated her 2nd Debut Anniversary! Our precious doggo streamed for a couple hours while talking about and looking at some things in her history as well as showing off a new Futoinu animation and a new microphone illustrated by her mama. Okayu also made a special song for Korone during a stream earlier that morning that Korone played during her celebration. I've embedded her anniversary stream below starting at Okayu's song:

As usual, it wouldn't be a celebration without merch. So here's what kind of swag you can pick up for Korone's anniversary:

- Mousepad drawn by fukahire-sensei (Korone's illustrator)
- Blanket designed by Korone herself
- A set of soft plush Koronesuki and Hosoinu keychains as well as metal Korone motif keychains
- A Koronesuki certificate/fan club card designed by Korone (only available in the full set)
- Special postcard illustrated by fukahire-sensei with a foil stamp Korone autograph (only available in the full set)

The full set costs 15,000 JPY (about $138 USD) but you can get the mousepad, blanket, or keychain sets separately for between 1,500 and 5,000 JPY (between $14 and $46 USD). Check out the official tweet below:

## Return of the VTuber Dad Manga

Calli is back this week with another read-along of the "My Dad is the Queen of All VTubers" manga. The first video for this read-along was a HUGE hit and actually is what led to Calli earning the nickname "Dad" but it apparently caught the attention of the English translator for the manga. Over in the comments section of the video, he posted:

> Thanks for lending your voice to the manga again, it was really funny! Watching yours and others' streams helped inspire me a little when translating it, too! Spent most of the stream laughing my ass off at your delivery. Thanks so much for your kind words, and I hope to see you for the final volume when it comes out, no pressure of course!

Today, he even tweeted out a few thoughts on his reactions to Calli's reading:

This stream was absolutely hilarious and Calli kills it with her delivery all throughout the stream. She really is a natural entertainer and streams like this do an excellent job of showing off her ability to cut loose and just have a good time with chat. Go check it out:

## Kanata and Towa Cover Usseewa

Usseewa is growing in popularity within Hololive for covers after Shion premiered her version of it a bit ago. Along with Nene's cover of the song, we're also getting one from Kanata and Towa as well. I really enjoyed Nene's version and these two girls are also big standouts for this song because of the power they both have behind their voices.

I'll be honest, this is probably my favorite version of the three so far. It'll be interesting to see who else within Hololive gives this song a spin. I think I'd like to hear Flare cover this, in particular? Anyway, check out these two angels below:

## Fan-made Drum Chart for Ghost in DTXMania

YouTube channel "APPROVED DTX Gaming" put up a video of a drum chart of Suisei's new original "GHOST" they created for DTXMania. I have a thing for hard-hitting percussion in music since I was a band kid back in the day, so I was instantly drawn into this song for how good the drum track is. In the main track, the drums kind of take a bit of a backseat to the rest of the instrumental, but this does a really good job of pulling them to the surface to show just how incredible they are.

Props to this guy for putting this chart together as well as playing it so well. This was seriously impressive. Check out the video below to see it for yourself:

## Suisei's "GHOST" Topping Song Rankings

Speaking of GHOST, it would seem that I'm not alone in my love for Suisei's latest song as she's hit #1 on both the iTunes Japan and the Oricon Song Downloads Rankings. If you haven't heard Suisei's latest song, I'm embedding the MV below so check it out:
