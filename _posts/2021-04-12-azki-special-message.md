Hey, everybody. Doing something a little different today. Yesterday was
[our Weekly Roundup][Roundup6] which included coverage of AZKi's 7th Solo Live.
Instead of a normal HoloDay post today, I want to take a moment to talk a little
more about AZKi. Specifically, the special message she shared in the middle of
the show.

## Clearing Up Some Misconceptions

Thanks to community translators Shrek Wazowski and Akuma from
[the LiveTL Discord][LiveTLDiscord], a full translation of AZKi's remarks from
the concert has been produced. **Just as a disclaimer**, these are volunteer
translators from the community and have no affiliation with Cover Corp or
Hololive Production. Language translation isn't an exact science and requires
some amount of interpretation on the side of the translator. It is possible that
there could be some translation errors, but we believe we have reached a pretty
close approximation of the message that AZKi was trying to send.

First, let's get right to the meat of things: AZKi did **not** say that she's
graduating or retiring and she said that the message she was sharing is not a
sad one. Based on what we believe was said, it seems like the AZKi Diva Project
had a pre-determined end date in July of 2022. It sounds like this is something
that was decided long ago because AZKi said that it's something she has been
thinking about for a very long time.

Based on her statement of moving from "Route Alpha" to "Route Beta", I think it
is safe to say that the plans have changed. The significance of the event and
its name, "Stand at the crossroads", is reflected in AZKi's assertion that she
is starting down a new path. This "Route Beta" as she calls it. What that means
for her exact future is uncertain, but more than anything she seems thankful to
her Pioneers for their love and support which has enabled this new path in the
journey she is on.

We try to avoid speculation on this site, so I won't make any guesses to what
exactly this all means or how AZKi's future may look. I think the community,
in general, knows enough about what's transpired recently to make some educated
guesses, but we'll wait for AZKi or Cover to make an official announcement about
what her plans and future look like.

I've embedded the concert archive below timestamped to the MC section where she
talks about all of this. Below that is the full, unedited translation that was
produced and QC'd by the community translators.

> 1:53:11 -- I have something I've really wanted to talk to you guys about. This is my first time talking about this… and by no means is this bad news at all, so please listen.
> 
> 1:53:33 -- Regarding the AzKi Project, actually, the end of AzKi Project has been decided. In other words, it's a project to make a beautiful end. And it's been decided in July 2022.
> 
> 1:54:11 -- This is something I've been thinking about and have decided for a very long time. And that's why to turn towards that goal. I'm doing what I can do, one step at a time like; music, singing, something to leave behind, or doing something that everyone would like, is something I wonder and ask about myself while doing my activities.
> 
> 1:54:51 -- Um, BUT, I am just myself. For the past 2 and a half years, we've walked together, with the AzKi Team, and just like now we're spending our time together with the Pioneers. Someday I hope that we can make more and more dreams into reality. 
> 
> 1:55:23 -- Right now, I have a lot of dreams like "I want to do something like this" or "I want to do a concert in this place someday"
> 
> 1:55:34 -- That's why today, and from now we'll be moving from Route Alpha to Route Beta.
> 
> 1:55:46 -- To the other side of the end that I decided on, I want to aim for bigger stages. 
> 
> 1:55:57 -- The fact that I can do a concert today is something that's not "Natural" but it's more of a feeling, of making something into a reality, and the continued support from you guys really is a great value. And that's why I believe that I'm able to stand here because of that.
> 
> 1:56:26 -- You guys gave me this crossroads, Thank you. That's why, As for our meeting for the first time, the memories we made here in ENTAS, is our new start and this time with the cooperation of many people, I was able to perform this Live Virtual ENTAS.
> 
> 1:56:56 -- From now on, would you like to write our own world together with me? Without everyone, AzKi wouldn't exist as AzKi. And that's what I thought. Right here and right now let's make our own path together. 
> 
> 1:57:22 -- And for the tremendous amount of love that you gave me, I'll take you to a bigger world that's full of happiness.
> 
> 1:57:45 -- The existence of AzKi is here because of the Pioneers. And for me you guys are irreplaceable, and I hope that I can also be irreplaceable to you guys.

## What We _DO_ Know

AZKi is clearly planning to perform for the foreseeable future. She doesn't look
like she has any intention of stopping and, if anything, looks even more excited
to push for bigger and better things. This begins with having already
announced her next solo live:

On June 13th, AZKi is going to have her first solo show in a live venue
since the pandemic. I'm excited to see her perform in front of a crowd again.
Also, since I forgot to mention it yesterday, you can get an acrylic panel of
the key art from "Stand at the crossroads"
[over on the official AZKi store][AZKiPanel] for 2,500 JPY (about $23 USD).
These panels are only available for a limited time, so if you want one you need
to put an order in soon. Sadly, they do not ship outside of Japan, so overseas
bros will need a forwarding service if you want to pick one up. Personally, I
use [Blackship][Blackship] but there are several others you could look into.

## Closing Thoughts

There's currently no way to know _exactly_ what is in store for AZKi's long-term
future, short of Cover coming out and explicitly declaring their intent. Based
on our interpretation of what AZKi said yesterday, we think it may be a while
before we get any hard details on what AZKi's future looks like, but we're
going to continue supporting her for as long as we can. I hope you do too.
