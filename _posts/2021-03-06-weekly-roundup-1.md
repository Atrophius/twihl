Welcome to This Week in Hololive's Weekly Roundup where we attempt to summarize
a lot of the interesting happenings of the last week.

Let's start with the real big stuff from this week ...

## New Outfits

Gen 0 is having a pretty big couple weeks. Last week, AZKi debuted her new look
which is a pretty stark difference compared to her last outfit. The virtual diva
now looks like she could be Sora's long-lost sister.

This week, the #1 idol herself debuted her own new look. Early this week, Sora
showed off a new casual outfit and took the viewers on a virtual date that
ended on a beach with fireworks. There's a lot of highlights from this stream
and I genuinely could spend the rest of this post talking about just that, but
I'm gonna recommend you go [check it out][SoraNewOutfit].

This morning, Miko showed off her own new look and it was absolutely adorable.
I don't have a system setup for images yet for these posts or I would be filling
this one with snaps of both Sora and Miko's new looks. I really recommend you go
[see Miko's new look for yourself][MikiNewOutfit].

## Birthdays!

Nene (3/2) and Miko (3/5) had their birthdays this week. Nene's celebration was
just what you would expect from a giant ball of diabetes-inducing energy, but
she also released [a new original song][NeneSong] that is adorable. This one
isn't going on my personal playlist, but I've listened to it a few times and
it's pretty representative of Nene.

Miko's birthday was something special. Miko's 35P fanbase organized a
[*twenty minute* long birthday tribute video][MikoBdayVideo] that included
music, fanart, personal messages and birthday wishes. And to cap it off, it
included a cameo of Michael De Santa from GTA V's Voice Actor, Ned Luke, doing
a personal birthday message to her on behalf of the community. It was a
wonderful video that shows just how much Miko's fans love and adore her.

## Kiara's YouTube Woes

I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this, because it's bad news and mostly a
lot of speculation since we don't really know what's going on. Up until very
recently, Kiara has been shadowbanned on YouTube which was preventing her
channel from showing up in search or her videos from being properly distributed
out to subs and recommendations. The good news is that this is seemingly over,
finally. The bad news is that it came at the cost of YouTube apparently removing
2 months worth of her content for alleged "ToS Violations" including her most
recent original song, Heart Challenger.

Obviously, everyone's was upset, not the least of which Kiara. YouTube has had a
real long history of ridiculous content moderation behavior, since most of it is
automated. Thankfully, it seems like Kiara's content was restored and her videos
are all visible again. Hopefully Tenchou won't get too down over YouTube's
shenanigans.

## Undertale Update

A lot of the girls have been playing through Undertale recently, most notably
some really incredible G-route runs. At the end of last week, both Matsuri and
Rushia made it to the Sans fight but have both since not played the game very
much this week. Matsuri is currently sitting at a little over 10 deaths on the
fight where Rushia has over 90.

Roboco has finished her N-route run and has started P-route. Judging by
how she behaved on her N-route, I think everyone is expecting and looking
forward to when she plays through G-route.

Just as a reminder, here's the current Sans leaderboard for the girls:

1. Houshou Marine with 21 deaths (2h23m)
2. Shiranui Flare with 29 deaths (4h21m)
3. Hoshimachi Suisei with 101 deaths (5h32m)
4. Shirakami Fubuki with 113 deaths (5h35m)
5. Oozora Subaru with 171 deaths (17h00m)
6. Amane Kanata with 341 deaths (31h10m)

Speaking of Fubuki, she's been doing G-route RTA speedruns which have been fun
to watch. Her current record is sub-1:20 and included a single attempt, 6m17s
Sans fight. She's had single-attempt runs on both Sans and Undyne at this point,
so getting that time even lower is well within her capabilities. It'll be fun
to see if she continues doing G-route runs for a bit longer.

## Interesting Content

As I'm wrapping up this post, I want to point you in the direction of some
standard content that I've personally enjoyed a lot this week:

### SMOK Collabs

Subaru, Mio, Okayu, and Korone (also known as SMOK) is one of the most blessed
collab groups in all of Hololive. These girls love hanging out with each other
and it's always a really fun and hilarious time for everyone involved. The
laughs I've gotten out of these girls this week has been well-appreciated and
I'm always looking forward to more from this group.

### Okayu's DKC2 Playthrough

This is one of my favorite games of all time and Okayu playing it has just been
a really chill and relaxing experience, like most things Okayu does. I highly
recommend watching some of this playthrough or even just throwing it on in the
background while you do other things.

### English Learning Streams

Roboco and Noel both did English learning streams this week. A lot of the girls
are working really hard to be able to communicate with their overseas fans and
it's really endearing watching them start to build that bridge. And beyond that,
the broken English is frequently really entertaining.

## Milestones

I think it'll be tradition to end with some notable milestones that were hit in
the last week. So, here's this week's major milestones:

* Sakura Miko - 900k Subscribers
* Uruha Rushia - **ONE MILLION** Subscribers
* Shishiro Botan - 700k Subscribers
* Momosuzu Nene - 500k Subscribers
* Shirogane Noel - 900k Subscribers
* Omaru Polka - 600k Subscribers

## Closing Thoughts

It's been a pretty busy first week of March. Bloom was not that long ago, but
the girls have seemingly recouped pretty well from that event and are full-steam
ahead into the rest of the year. If you enjoyed this post and want to see more
