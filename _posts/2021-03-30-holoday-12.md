<abbr title="Haachamachama~~! (Haachama's greeting)">はあちゃまちゃま～～！</abbr>

Welcome to another HoloDay! Today we are, of course, taking a look at Haachama's
return stream but we also had some great music today in the form of a collab
between Rikka and Calli as well as a new cover collab by Gura and Matsuri!

Also, [this week's HoloNews issue for March 22-28 is now available][HoloNews]!
Go check that out over on Reddit to catch up on recent collabs, playthroughs,
and some stories I didn't have a chance to cover here. Let's get into it!

## Rikka's RiTunes Labo with Special Guest Mori Calliope!

Rikka hosted his RiTunes Labo show this morning with Calli as his guest
following the debut of their new original song during his 3D Live last week.
They chatted for a bit and then sang some songs together with Rikka on his
acoustic guitar. This is going to be the first time I ever embed the same
stream twice on two different timestamps because it's important that you at
least listen to the acoustic version of Live Again as well as the two of them
actually being able to perform Spiral Tones together live. But, as usual, ALL
of the songs from this stream are fantastic. Other than these two, I highly
recommend you go check out the acoustic God Knows as well.

## Haachama's Return Stream

Haachama's return stream was this morning which brought us what looks like the
conclusion of the Haachama lore series, at least for now. The stream started
with a bit more backstory of the relationship between Haato and her older sister
Haachama, with Haato asking Haachama if they will always be together and
Haachama affirming that fact. It showed some scenes of the girls playing
together before ending in the revelation that Haachama was killed in a car
accident. It's implied that Haato went insane after losing her older sister
Haachama and took on her alternate personality as a coping mechanism. Then the
fan song from "Bad End" was replayed and the scene ended with both girls dead
together.

After, Haachama played the "True End" which showed the girls together and happy.
The video concludes with the sound of an alarm and the perspective of Haachama
being woken up by Haato who tells her that if she doesn't wake up she'll be late
for school and they should go together. This implies that the entire arc was
Haachama's nightmare.

With that conclusion, Haachama played a montage of scenes from the lore arc and
then finally returned to the stream as herself where she talked with chat
briefly about the creation process for the lore and how everything started and
progressed. She described how she mentioned having a plan for her 1M Subscribers
milestone but it turns out there was no plan and she kind of was just winging it
throughout this whole process with the help of inspiration she got from fans
making content about the story. She also talked about how she's always had a
dream of releasing a movie or a manga or an anime and how this story was kind of
a first step toward that goal.

It's actually crazy impressive how she was able to tie everything together from
her own ideas and including fan works as well as using fan ideas throughout the
entire process. It resulted in one of the most engaging story arcs that had
people roped in and watching day to day for over a month and Haachama's stream
today peaked at over 70k concurrent viewers all here to see the finale and
welcome the strongest idol home.

I've embedded the stream below. It's quite a trip. Also you can go get a recap
of [all the previous lore here][HaatoLore].

## Gura and Matsuri's Sorairo Days

It's Gura's first official cover song release! She teamed up with her Gen 1
senpai, Matsuri, to bring us this awesome cover of Sorairo Days. In case you
happen to be living under a rock, Sorairo Days is the OP of Gurren Lagann and
an anime you should probably go watch right now if this is news to you. I've
embedded the MV below, so check it out:

## Wrapping Up

Man, what a week it has been already and it's only Tuesday! I'm personally
really happy to see Haachama back and she sounds like she had a nice break and
is in high spirits. The Rikka/Calli and Gura/Matsuri collabs were phenomenal and
I really can't wait to see the MV for Spiral Tones.
