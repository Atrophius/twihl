Welcome to This Week in Hololive's Weekly Roundup where we attempt to summarize
a lot of the interesting happenings of the last week. You probably noticed that
I was a bit absent this week, so I want to talk about that and what the future
of this website looks like. After that, we'll get into some fun music news.
Let's go!

## Week in Hololive Changes

I took a week off from writing because I knew there was no way I was going to be
able to sustainably keep up with everything happening with Hololive in the midst
of everything else I needed and wanted to give my attention to for the week. So
for the sake of my health, I had to let the website take a back seat for a bit.
That brought up a lot of questions about what I really want to be doing and
talking about here, so I want to share some of those thoughts with you now.

### Less General Hololive News and More Hololive Idol News

The basic summary of the immediate changes is that I will be paring down my solo
coverage of Hololive to just the part that I am the most passionate about:
**the music**. I'm also going to be retiring the HoloDay article format in favor
of more focused articles around individual, major and minor musical events. This
week or next week will also likely be the last of the Weekly Roundup in this
exact format.

I'm planning to explore an alternate format for the Weekly Roundup so that I can
continue to provide coverage of interesting things happening inside of Hololive
that _are not_ directly related to music, but in a more succinct format that
will be both easier to produce and consume. I'm also going to start more
prominently promoting issues of the HoloNews fanzine because they already do a
very good job of summarizing the past week and I also contribute there from time
to time.

Keep an eye out for the banner at the top of the page. Going forward, it will
update on every Tuesday with the link to the latest HoloNews issue. I'm also
going to put together an archive page that will link to historical issues of
the fanzine soon. **Okay, let's move on to this past week!**

## Kanata's Birthday Concert

For her birthday, Kanata held a 3D Live Concert featuring a ton of special guests, including Mel, Noel, Haachama, Towa, AZKi, Marine, Ayame, and the **entirety** of 5th Gen, starting with a duet with Nene.

The concert started off on a standard stage with Kanata doing an adorable rendition of Renai Circulation with Mel and Noel before eventually moving to the abandoned cathedral scene that's been a common location for her and Towa for quite some time. The concert came back to the stage after Kanata's performance with AZKi for remainder of the event that led up to Kanata debuting a new cover live before it premiered as a separate video on her channel. Then she surprised everyone with a big group of unannounced guests including Mio, Fubuki, Miko, and the rest of 5th Gen. Check out the full setlist below:

1. Noel, Mel, Kanata - Renai Circulation
2. Haachama & Kanata - Sweet Magic
3. Towa & Kanata - Usseewa
4. Nene & Kanata - Loser
5. Azki & Kanata - Sekai Gofun Mae Kasetsu
6. Marine & Kanata - Uchiage Hanabi
7. Ayame & Kanata - Platinum
8. Kanata - Hibana
9. Mio, Fubuki, Miko, Polka, Lamy, Botan, Kanata - UMAPYOI DENTETSU

I'm embedding the concert below at her performance with Nene. Mostly because I *can't get enough of 3D Super Nenechi*. Literally, just pump it into my veins. I can't wait to see Nene develop over the next several months now that she's finally made her 3D Debut.

## Full Bouquet Album Released!

The hololive IDOL PROJECT's first full album, Bouquet, has officially released for both physical and streaming purchases. You can also find it on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, etc. if you're more of a streaming music kind of person.

This album includes updated, much higher quality mixes of all of the songs from the Bloom series of "9 original songs in 9 weeks" as well as the new songs that were debuted at Bloom. It also includes a new album-only track "Important Photograph" that you can't find anywhere else. Check out the tweet below for a link to all the different places you can find it:

## Suisei's "GHOST" Hits #5 on Billboard Japan Download Chart

Continuing the growing accolades for Suisei's latest original song, GHOST ranked on the Billboard Japan Download Chart for its debut week of April 12 - 18. The Billboard charts are pretty exclusive and it's a testament to just how good Suisei's new song is that it managed to rank there.

To celebrate, Suisei held a karaoke stream singing a variety of songs but I specifically want to highlight her early version of HoloEN Mori Calliope's "Red" from her new EP. Suisei is practicing the song and wasn't really intending to sing it that day, but she showed off what she has so far and it *sounds great*. I hope she eventually does the full song. You can find her reaction tweet to the chart news and her karaoke stream, starting at Red, both embedded below:

## The8BitDrummer Plays Suisei's GHOST

While we're on the topic of Suisei's new song, I want to give a special shoutout to Jerod a.k.a. "The8BitDrumer" for playing GHOST on his stream recently. Jerod does drum improv over the top of song requests from his community and Suisei's new song got requested **quite a lot** of times by Hoshiyomis who are also fans of his drumming. He's previously done other Hololive songs, including Towa's ERROR, which are also fantastic.

Jerod is seriously impressive and I've been a big fan of his since before I fell into the rabbit hole, so seeing worlds collide like this is quite a treat for me. I've embedded his stream VOD below at the beginning of the segment containing GHOST. Definitely check it out:

## Mio and Ayame's Impromptu Ukulele Collab

I'm gonna close out today's Weekly Roundup with this blessed collab between Mama Mio and her daughter Ayame. Ayame went home with Mio after the Kanata birthday concert so that they could stream together doing some singing over Mio's ukulele. It was a wonderful stream that's worth watching in its entirety, of course, but I'm embedding it below at "secret base" the Anohana ED:
