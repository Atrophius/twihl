<abbr title="Konpeko, konpeko, konpeko! (Pekora's greeting)">こんぺこ、こんぺこ、こんぺこ！</abbr>

Welcome to another HoloDay! I was feeling a little under the weather this week,
so I had to take a small break from writing, but we're back! Today we're talking
about the Rise Takeover of Hololive, Sora's 700k Celebration, OMOCAT's fanart
of Calli, and the Bouquet Cover Art is out! Let's go!

## Hololive Monster Hunters

It has officially begun. Monster Hunter Rise is out over in Japan (it will
release later tonight for overseas bros) and several members have already
started their adventures. I knew this game was going to get a lot of attention
once the Capcom deal was finalized. As of this writing, there are currently
six active Rise streams between Hololive and Holostars with more likely coming
tomorrow.

There will be no shortage of Rise content for a while, so if you're both a
Hololive and a Monster Hunter fan, go see if your favorite talent is streaming
the game. Head on over to [our resources page][TWIHLResources] and visit
HoloTools to see the upcoming schedule as well as everyone currently streaming.

## Sora's 700k Celebration + Parallel Time Blu-ray Now Available!

At the beginning of the week, Sora held a 700k celebration stream that included
her making a big list of things she would like to do between now and 800k
Subscribers. It's quite a list and includes things like a potential cooking
stream, more collabs, improving her English skills, and more.

At the end, she changed from her casual outfit and went full idol mode to give
a quick performance of her song "I love you so much, I think I'm going to cry"
and "Shiny Smily Story". I've embedded the stream below at the SSS performance,
but be sure to check out the rest:

In more Sora news, the Blu-ray release of her most recent solo concert "Parallel
Time" is out! This was an incredible show from Sora and a highly recommended
watch if you're a Soratomo. My copy is on its way and you can check out Sora's
tweet below for a link to the website to purchase. Just as a heads up, Amazon
Japan will directly ship this overseas!

## Calli and OMORI

Calli just recently finished her playthrough of OMORI and OMOCAT, the creator of
the game, celebrated by drawing some OMORI-themed fanart of our favorite
adorkable reaper. Calli had an ... interesting reaction:

Sasuga Reaper Dad. Check out [OMOCAT's original tweet here](https://twitter.com/_omocat/status/1374116319642017798).

## Bouquet Cover Art

It's getting closer to Bouquet's release date, which means cover art! The
IDOL PROJECT's first album had its cover art announced earlier this week and it
is adorable. There are also pre-order bonuses for the album you might want to
check out. I've embedded the official announcement tweet below, so go take a
look:

## Wrapping Up

Time to get the ball rolling again now that I'm feeling better! We're going to
have a HoloArt Corner tomorrow since we missed it on Wednesday and then the
Weekly Roundup will be out on Sunday. Our schedule should be back to normal
again after that.
