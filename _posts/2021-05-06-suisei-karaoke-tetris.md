  Suisei decided that just singing or just playing Tetris alone wasn't really
  impressive enough, so why not do both?

This morning, Suisei decided to do a stream that was so impressive that it
pulled me out of my writing hiatus. Today we're talking about **Tetris Karaoke**.

## Suisei's Tetris Karaoke was Incredible

For the people who may not be familiar with Suisei, she's a bit of a Tetris
legend within Hololive. She's easily the best player across the agency, having
defeated some of the other girls in _mere seconds_, but she has also done quite
a lot of Tetris 99 streams where she shows off her skill. At one point, she
even went toe to toe with one of the highest ranked Tetris 99 players in the
world and still managed to hold her own.

She's also easily among the top vocalists within Hololive and regularly does
singing streams as well as uploading covers and original music. Most notably,
her latest single: GHOST. ([Go listen to that if you haven't already.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKKar5SS29E))
Suisei had already previously done a bit of a joke stream where she played Ring
Fit Adventure while singing, so this isn't completely new territory for her.
While that stream _was_ impressive, it's obviously really difficult to put your
all into singing while also doing strenuous physical activity, so that was more
comical than anything.

But ***this*** ... This stream was seriously something else. Once she got
started, I was completely hooked. I couldn't stop watching until it was over.
I'm going to embed the video below at the beginning of her 2nd game and also
where she performs "God Knows" (from Haruhi) as well as "Kaibutsu" by YOASOBI
(from Beastars). The full set list of her karaoke from this stream will be
below the video. If you were to ever take my advice of watching the entire
stream, this is definitely one to do it.
