<abbr title="Konyappi! (Towa's Greeting)">こんやっぴ！</abbr>

Yeah, I know I used Towa's greeting before already, but ***today is special***.

Welcome to another HoloDay and what a week it has been, so far. We got off to a
bit of a slow start this week, but it's been pretty non-stop since Tuesday.
Let's get caught up with Fubuki's 1.3M subs celebration, Aki's birthday
celebration, HoloEN's legendary UNO collab, and I'm gonna gush about Towa _again_
today ***because the MV for Palette just came out this morning***!

## PALETTE MUSIC VIDEO IS OUT

{% include yt_embed.html video="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud73fm4Uoq0" %}

I don't normally lead with the video, but this one is too good not to. Make sure
to turn captions on because the lyrics have been translated into English.

I already talked about how Towa was responsible for sending me freefalling into
the rabbit hole at an uncontrolled rate [back in HoloDay #5][HoloDay5]. When
this song debuted at Bloom, I was hoping for a MV release shortly after the
concert ended. We didn't get that. Instead, what we got was a digital release of
the single on all streaming platforms a few days after the concert. Acceptable,
because I just wanted to put the song on loop and had been looping her
performance at Bloom in the meantime. There was no mention of a MV at all, but
I was quietly hoping that it would be coming because the MVs tend to trend very
well on YouTube. Especially on the long-tail viewership as more people get
exposed to Hololive and start checking out the music.

And then the teaser happened:

{% include image.html name="teaser_reaction.png" caption="When I found out about the MV teaser ..." %}

I knew an amazing video would come out of this song. ***I knew it***. But what
we were given went beyond my wildest expectations. Hololive, in general, has had
a pretty high standard for MVs. The production quality of both the cover and
original videos has been good and only getting better over time. Palette's MV
takes that standard and just **outright shatters it**. Into a billion pieces.

The illustration, storyboard, and animation for this video was done by
[Kakage](https://twitter.com/kakage0904) and the video was produced by
[Roly](https://twitter.com/yosinO_mo). I cannot say enough about how incredible
the work they've done is. If I don't stop myself here, I'm going to go into a
full-blown analysis of the video and the lyrics. I'll save that for maybe
another day, but go support the artists involved in the creation of this
masterpiece.

## Suisei Celebrates 800k Subscribers

Suisei celebrated her reaching 800k Subscribers this week with a short karaoke
stream. She consulted with her doctor regarding her throat problems and was
cleared to do some singing on stream to celebrate. Despite being noticably
conservative on her voice in order to protect her throat, the singing was
amazing. Sadly, YouTube seems to have bonked the archive with a copyright claim.

In the meantime, here's a clip of her singing Arrietty's Song from the stream:

## Fubuki Celebrates 1.3M Subscribers

Here on this site, we track and report talent subscriber milestones in the
weekly roundup using the same increments as the official subreddit. It's every
10k up until 100k, then every 100k until 1M, then every 250k thereafter. So,
Fubuki's latest milestone won't appear in this week's roundup, but I wanted to
briefly talk about her 1.3M celebration because she held a karaoke stream that
had a heartfelt message at the end for her fans about where she is and how much
farther she believes she can go. I'll embed a translated clip of that section
below:

## Aki's Birthday Celebration

Aki's birthday was back in February, but her celebration was delayed for a while
because she wanted to do a 3D Live to celebrate. This was a fun stream that had
some variety style content at the beginning including call-ins from Coco,
Kanata, Mel, Fubuki, and Matsuri. In the later part of the stream, she performed
a few songs including "Tour of the moon and the sun" which included a dance
routine in Aki's signature style. I've embedded the stream below, timestamped to
that performance:

Aki's birthday merch is also on sale and includes:

* An MV video set of her latest original song, including a choreography video
* A voice pack
* An acrylic panel
* A beer mug
* A rubber coaster
* An Aki bottle opener

{% include tweet_embed.html tweet="https://twitter.com/hololivetv/status/1372170861936009217" %}

Aki also released the music video for her new original song after the stream was
over:

## HoloEN UNO Madness

Ina, Calli, Kiara, and Gura did an UNO collab stream that has been a giant meme
factory thanks to the girls enacting very special punishments on the losers
throughout the stream. This stream was both cursed and hilarious and included
things like Kiara being a baby for quite a while, Calli's acknowledgement that
she is dad, Ina sharing some information that will be worshipped by Reddit for
the foreseeable future, and grandma Gura. Seriously, check out this stream below
and also go browse through all the hilarious memes that came out of this stream
[over on Reddit][HololiveReddit].

This next one is a clip of Polka that I could only find on Twitter with this
specific editing:

> You really didn't have to do us like that, Polka ...

I love this Polka clip because it has "small small turtle house" energy ...

## Wrapping Up

***AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!*** I'm probably listening to Palette non-stop again now
that the MV is out. In case it wasn't clear, this was the _really exciting thing_
coming this week that I mentioned in Tuesday's HoloDay.

Tomorrow, we've got another HoloDay and our next special post for Suisei week.
