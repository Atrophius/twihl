<abbr title="Konnichiwasshoi! (Matsuri's greeting.)">こんにちわっしょーい！</abbr>

Welcome to a new week! It's time for HoloDay #11 and we're kicking the week off
with some really exciting news about Haachama as well as a big karaoke party
with some excellent singing from some of the girls. Let's get into it!

## HAACHAMA IS COMING BACK

The big news of the day is about Haachama's return. Over the weekend, the bulk
of Haachama's lore videos were unprivated and the description of the most recent
one was edited to remove the details about the "new rule" which had been enacted
that made the series difficult to complete.

All of the videos returned on the 28th, and if you're familiar with the lore you
will know that all "8" days are "Haachama Days". Then today, we have a new
stream on the schedule for tomorrow, confirming Haachama is indeed returning. If
you're not up to speed on the lore, you can check out [HoloDay #2][HoloDay2]
which has a link to a gallery of fan summaries of all the videos and streams
from this series.

Be on the lookout for tomorrow's HoloDay, because I'll be talking about what
happens in Haachama's upcoming video there.

## Karaoke Party!

There's a ton of recent singing streams you may have missed, including some that
just happened this morning. We'll start with Matsuri who just had an endurance
karaoke stream to 900k Subscribers over the weekend. This was just shy of 3
hours long and included quite a variety of songs. I've embedded the video below
at her rendition of the Japanese version of "Part of Your World" because I
absolutely **LOVE** when Matsuri sings this song. It's so good.

Continuing the Karaoke party this morning was Aqua. She performed Sparkle from
Your Name at the end of her stream today, which is one of my favorite songs
(also a [quick shoutout to Mio's cover][MioSparkle] for being absolutely
amazing). I've embedded Aqua's stream at Sparkle:

The last one I'll talk about today is, of course, my oshi Suisei. Suisei has
been streaming with her new stream voice for a couple days now and *it sounds
great*, just so you know. Speaking of sounding great, Suisei's voice was
**absolutely amazing** today. I think it's clear that her voice is sounding
healthier and you can really hear the extent of her vocal range in some of the
songs she did today. I'll be embedding the stream at "Beautiful World" but, as
always, I highly recommend watching the rest:

## New HoloGra featuring Subaru, Noel, Watame, and Lamy

A new week means a new episode of Holo no Graffiti, Hololive's weekly animation
series starring the girls. The localization team for HoloGra is excellent and
all of the episodes are captioned, so be sure to check out the others you may
have missed. I've embedded this week's episode below:

## Coco's 1M Subscribers Celebration

Coco held a celebration stream this weekend that was a celebration of her
hitting the big 1M milestone. This stream ended up being a literal speedrun of
all of the segments she's done on her channel that she's well-known for,
including AsaCoco, Meme Review, a cooking stream, and more! I've embedded her
stream below at the absolutely hilarious "AsaCoco for Kids" segment, but do
watch the entire thing. Coco's amazing.

## Botan Featured Xbox Game Pass

Botan had a sponsored stream for Xbox Game Pass this morning where she showed
off what the benefits of the subscription is and played a little Gears of War
and Control. Xbox doing sponsored streams with Hololive is pretty interesting
considering they have had ... we'll say, less than stellar console sales
performance in Japan. Especially compared to their Japan-native competition in
both Sony and Nintendo.

This could be a pretty genius marketing strategy for Xbox. The official Xbox
twitter account has already been known to tweet at some Hololive girls in the
past, so maybe this has been coming for a while. I'm personally looking forward
to Phil Spencer shouting out Botan. Come on, Phil. Botan's stream is embedded
below, if you want to take a look:

## Wrapping Up

This week is off to a bang with the Haachama news and tomorrow is going to be
even bigger. I mentioned in yesterday's roundup that I was anticipating another
busy week and we're roaring out the gate on Day 1. I'm really excited for
tomorrow, so be on the lookout for the next HoloDay!
