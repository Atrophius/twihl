HoloDay #5 is here! Today is Anya's birthday! Her birthday merch is now
available, Shion is back with a new song cover, and Towa gave us a look at what
an a cappella version of her new original Palette may sound like.
[Hexagon][Hexagon]!

## Happy Birthday, Anya!

The lovely and sweet Keris of HoloID 2nd Gen had her birthday today, including
a celebration stream where she did some singing and announced her new birthday
merch! More details on the merch in a moment, but you can check out her birthday
celebration stream below:

For her birthday, the amazingly talented Ina and Calli both drew some art of
Anya. Calli did an [art stream][CalliArtStream] last night where she polled
chat to determine what she would draw and an Anya birthday drawing won by quite
a large margin. Have a look at this fantastic artwork:

As is customary when a talent celebrates their birthday, Anya's birthday merch
is now available. You can get a tote bag, keychain, and voice pack.

## Shion's New Cover

Shion's been away for a bit on some kind of break, having not streamed or been
active on her socials for several days. As is typical, her Shiokko started to
worry since there had been no public announcement of any break or anything. And
now Shion is back with a *very on-brand* cover that suits her very well.

This is a fun song. I'm gonna listen to it a few more times to make a decision
on whether or not it goes into my personal favorites playlist, but you can
check it out for yourself below.

## Towa's Latest Karaoke Stream

Towa is my personal #2 vocalist in Hololive after Suisei. And those two are
fighting for the top spot. [In yesterday's HoloDay][HoloDay4], I talked about
how Calli was responsible for pulling me into the rabbit hole with her music.
Well, Towa is responsible for sending me free-falling at an uncontrolled rate.
Music is my weakness.

I saw all the promotion for Beyond the Stage and found out that you could watch
the first 30 minutes for free, and hoo boy ... That first 30 minutes included
Towa's live performance of ERROR. I've never bought a concert ticket so fast in
my life. Prior to that, I didn't really pay much attention to anyone besides the
EN talents. And now it's a joke between me and my wife that we have 44 (if
you include A-chan) daughters now.

Towa debuted her first original song, Palette, live during the Bloom concert
Hololive had last month. I may have had a ... *reaction* to that while I was
live-tweeting the concert.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">YES <a href="https://twitter.com/tokoyamitowa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tokoyamitowa</a> SOLO. Speaking of voices I&#39;m absolutely in love with. There&#39;s the tears. It happened. Her voice is so emotional and powerful.<br><br>THANK YOU FOR GETTING ME INTO THIS TOWA-SAMA! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E8%8A%B1%E5%92%B2%E3%81%8F%E3%83%9B%E3%83%AD%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%96?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#花咲くホロライブ</a> <br><br>🧵(23/?) <a href="https://t.co/mPZq1t6cHy">pic.twitter.com/mPZq1t6cHy</a></p>&mdash; Atrophius (@Atrophius) <a href="https://twitter.com/Atrophius/status/1362001310871138308?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2021</a></blockquote>

All that to basically say, I love Towa's singing. And I think Palette is so
exceptionally suited to her voice, which is no surprise considering it was
composed by the same person who did both ERROR and brilliant, which Towa has
covered amazingly already.

Here latest karaoke stream is below. I've timestamped it to the a cappella
Palette verse, but the entire thing is worth a listen. Also, I can't be the only
one who's interested in a full version of this song a cappella now, right?

## Check out these clips

Here's a few fun clips that I enjoyed recently. If you're looking for more
clips, head on over to [our resources page][TWIHLResources] where you can find
a list of quality clippers. I've also started tagging some of these with the
talents that they commonly clip and will be filling out these tags more over
time.

## Wrapping Up

That's it for today. Tomorrow is the Weekly Roundup! And I think going forward,
Sunday will be break days or only really big announcements if something happens.
HoloDay will be back on Monday. I think I'm finalizing a content schedule now
that I'm getting into the grove of things.

Thanks for reading! Be sure to [give us a follow][TWIHLTwitter] over on Twitter
