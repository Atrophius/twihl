Welcome to a new week! I normally cover Sunday stuff on Mondays because Mondays
are usually a little slow, but the big news from Sunday was all about Calli's
birthday and EP + V-Carnival which
[I already talked about in the weekly roundup][Roundup5]. Go check that out in
case you missed it.

Today we're talking about Calli's EP performance, the new HoloGra, and checking
out a few fun recent clips.

## Calli's EP Tops iTunes Music Charts

Calli is killing it with her new EP, managing to top the iTunes Charts for "Rap
& Hiphop" in **both** the US and Japan. It's really great to see her music doing
so well and I hope she gets some much deserved rest after the crazy amount of
work she's been putting in lately to get this out plus the other collabs she's
been involved in.

## HoloGra #100, Extra Fever Dream Edition

A new week means a new episode of Holo no Graffiti, Hololive's weekly animation
series starring the girls. The localization team for HoloGra is excellent and
all of the episodes are captioned, so be sure to check out the others you may
have missed. I've embedded this week's episode below:

## Wrapping Up

It's a slow start to the week, but I'm sure it'll ramp up soon. I'm personally
enjoying a bit of a break because it's been pretty non-stop for the last two
weeks and we've got some big events coming up soon. More on that later this
week!
