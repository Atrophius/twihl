It's our first HoloDay post and we're kicking things off with big news from an
underappreciated part of Hololive.

## Yukoku Roberu's 3D Debut!

Yukoku Roberu, everyone's favorite Winning Son, has announced that he will be
debuting his 3D model this week on Wednesday, March 10th at 20:00 JST (that's
6 AM ET for other <abbr title="Kaigai-Niki - Overseas Bros">海外ニキ</abbr> like
myself).

I'm planning to try to get a system in place for images on this site by then,
so I'll try and grab some shots of Roberu in all his 3D glory to include in
Wednesday's HoloDay post.

## IoSoRadio 3

This morning was another episode of Sora + Iofi's IoSoRadio show over on
[Iofi's channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MHa6G-M3Fk). I love the
dynamic that these two have and this is the first episode in Sora's new outfit
so they look even more like they could really be sisters. There was a really
great live translation presence in the chat for this stream. Check out
[our resources pages](/resources/) for some tools to help making watching Japanese Hololive
streams easier for those of us who don't know much or any Japanese.

## New Stuff and Coming Soon

I wanted to take a quick second to again point out the
[resources page](/resources) which went up today. As well as the new page
[listing all of the Hololive talents](/holomem/) (minus HoloStars at the moment,
I'll be adding them all soon).

Also some new information has been posted to the [homepage](/) regarding
upcoming content series and my plans for this website. Check all of that stuff
out and if that stuff interests you, the best way to keep up with the site for
now is to [follow on Twitter](https://twitter.com/WeekInHololive).
