<abbr title="Konkapu~! (Mel's greeting)">こんかぷー!</abbr>

Welcome to another HoloDay! It's Friday and the weekend looms. I wonder what
interesting stuff will be happening this weekend? In case you missed it, I did
[an analysis of Towa's Palette MV][PaletteAnalysis] as a bonus article yesterday
and the first in the HoloMusic series.

Today, we're talking about AZKi's non-stop music festival along with some
milestones, new permissions, and Suisei's very interesting speedrun. Let's get
to it.

## AZKi's "Don't Stop The Music" Festival HAPPENING NOW

Hololive's Virtual Diva, AZKi, is hosting her 2nd Annual "Don't Stop The Music"
Festival starting earlier today. Originally billed as 48 hours of non-stop
music, the event actually received so many signups that it was extended out to
a whopping 72 hours. That's three full days of music. And it's happening
literally right now. You can tune into today's stream using the video below, but
check out this image AZKi posted of the full lineup of participants:

That's a _lot_ of VTubers ... Check out today's stream:

## Cover Signs Deal with Capcom

Cover announced last night that they had reached a comprehensive license
agreement for Capcom's library. Pekora has already started using the new
permissions to [play Resident Evil 2][PekoraRE2] and I'm anticipating that a lot
of the girls will probably be playing Monster Hunter soon, particularly Rise
when it releases later this month.

## Sora Karaoke to 700k Subscribers

Sora held a karaoke stream yesterday leading up to hitting her 700k Subscribers
milestone. It was a little light on the singing compared to a typical Sora
singing stream, as it seems Sora has also been dealing with some throat issues
recently. A lot of the girls are a little under the weather with seasonal stuff,
but Sora hit her milestone and still put on a good show.

## Luna Karaoke to 500k Subscribers

Luna was planning to do an endurance karaoke stream to 500k subscribers, but she
actually hit the milestone _before_ the stream started. She still some singing,
but the real fun was when she discovered a special video her LuKnights had made
for her to celebrate which included a special message from Tony Hawk. Luna has
previously played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 & 2 on stream, so he's a become a bit
of a running gag on the channel, but she was really delighted to see the tribute
her fans had put together for her. Check out the clip below:

## Suisei Speedruns Collab Setups

Suisei the Tetris Goddess decided to try and put her speed to the test on a new
challenge this morning where she live streamed herself cre-- *Wait, is this
right? The notes say she was just scheduling collabs? Okay ...*

Suisei dedicated an entire stream today to scheduling upcoming collaboration
streams with other HoloMembers. It looks like she's going to have a pretty busy
collab schedule for the next few weeks with GTA collabs coming up with Miko and
Flare, singing collab with Nene, Sausage Legend with Subaru, Apex with Aqua, and
more. So keep on the lookout for some fun Suisei collabs for a while.
