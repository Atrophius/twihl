*This article was originally planned to be apart of a series dedicated to Suisei
for her birthday, but the series was unfortunately dropped due to lack of
available time to finish the articles. Suisei will be back in future
installments of HoloHistory.*

Welcome to Suisei Week! Sui-chan's birthday and 3rd debut anniversary are coming
up very soon, so I wanted to do something a little special to honor my favorite
Hololive musician leading up to her special day.

I think I've made it [pretty][pretty] [clear][clear] now that I love Suisei. As
far as personalities and general entertainers go, I think Subaru and Ina are my
two favorite general content creators within Hololive. But a whole different
world opens up when you start to engross yourself in and begin to appreciate the
music that comes out of this group of girls. And Suisei is up at the top of that
mountain for me.

Today we're going to take a look back on how she got started.

## A Star is Born

Suisei's debut and birthday fall on the same day: March 22nd. She originally
debuted as an independent VTuber back in 2018. For context, the only talents
under Hololive at this time were the #1 idol Tokino Sora and Roboco, though
Roboco had only just debuted a couple weeks prior.

One of the most incredible things about Suisei is her talent and drive to make
things happen. That was apparent even in her early days because all of her
original VTuber assets she had made herself. She came up with her design and
learned everything she needed to know to be able to bring it to life on screen.

Suisei built up a small following around her debut and about a month later
released her first song, a cover of Meltyland Nightmare:

## Making Content and Persevering

Suisei continued on making content for the next year. Originally starting out
using a format very familiar to old school YouTubers and anyone who's seen a
of content on YouTube from before the live streaming age really set in. She
would produce clips and short videos, uploading them on a semi-regular schedule.

The content she produced included more music, of course, including some covers
like [Bluebird from Naruto Shippuden (OP3)][bluebird] and
[Genesis of Aquarion][genesis] as some of her earliest stuff. She had a great,
if undisciplined, voice that housed an enormous amount of potential.

During the summer of her first year, she briefly joined the VTuber group S:gnal.
This was a very short relationship as after only one month it was announced she
would be returning to independent status. Nobody knows the details of what the
S:gnal relationship was like, but the group now seems mostly defunct and their
talents inactive.

Sui-chan didn't let that get her down, though. She continued to push forward
even as an independent and announced that she would be debuting her first
original song later in the year ...

## 1st Original Song: Comet

For those who may not know,
[Suisei's name literally translates to "comet"][translate]. Which is a fitting
name for Suisei's first original. Suisei worked together with vocaloid
producer [*Luna][luna] who wrote the lyrics and arranged the track. Comet is
a catchy, upbeat tune that does a really good job of capturing the talent that
Suisei possessed even back not long after she started and gives us a tiny
glimpse into the incredible vocal range she was capable of that we would see a
lot more of in the coming years.

## Wrapping Up

That's all for today! More in our dedication to Suisei will be coming on Friday
where we'll look back at Suisei's 2nd original song, her transition into INNK
Music, and her first live concert performances.
