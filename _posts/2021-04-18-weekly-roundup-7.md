Welcome to This Week in Hololive's Weekly Roundup where we attempt to summarize
a lot of the interesting happenings of the last week. This was a HUGE musical
week for Hololive with a number of concerts and a ton of music being released.
Be sure to check out the HoloDays for anything you might have missed!

## Our Latest Articles

Almost every day, I post HoloDay articles recapping interesting things that
happened in the last couple days. We have **three** HoloDays this week.
Definitely go check these out for anything you might have missed this week!

* [HoloDay #19][HoloDay19] - It's a very musical HoloDay today with Suisei's special 3rd Anniversary / Birthday Live concert, Nene did a cover of Usseewa, and Moona did a cover of K/DA's VILLAIN.
* [HoloDay #20][HoloDay20] - Today we're talking about Korone's debut anniversary, Kanata and Towa's Usseewa cover, Calli doing more VTuber Dad reading, and Suisei's new song's rankings.
* [HoloDay #21][HoloDay21] - Today we're talking about Ina's "Drawfest" invitation, another blessed Mio Ukulele stream, Sora's impromptu Minecraft concert, and Perfectly Persistent Tenshi.

In addition to HoloDays, we also have three other ongoing articles series:
**The HoloArt Corner**, **HoloHistory**, and **HoloMusic**. The HoloArt Corner
is a series dedicated to featuring the amazing artistic works of fans and
members of the Hololive community. HoloHistory is a look back into the origins
and early days of our favorite idols. HoloMusic is a deeper look into some of
our favorite music from the various members of Hololive.

* [HoloArt Corner #3][HoloArt3] - Week 3 of the HoloArt Corner features Fan Art
of Miko, Risu, Haato, Aki, Lamy, Flare, Ina, Gura, Calli, Suisei, Ayame, and
A-chan!
* [HoloHistory #1][HoloHistory1] - We're kicking off HoloHistory with a look
back on Suisei's early days and her very first original song, Comet.
* [HoloMusic #1][HoloMusic1] - On the inaugural edition of "HoloMusic", we're
taking a deep look at Towa's new MV for her first original song: Palette.

## Towa's 1st Anniversary 3D Live Concert

After a long delay, presumably because of COVID-related concerns and the state of emergency in Japan, Towa was finally able to have her 1st Anniversary Concert this weekend. The concert featured a Live Band performing all of the songs and Towa also welcomed special guests: Hoshimachi Suisei of Hololive 0th Gen and Shishigami Leona from VTuber agency Re:AcT.

The live band really adds a lot to Towa's performances and the collabs at the beginning of the concert were super hype. The biggest highlight of the concert was her super emotional singing of Palette, backed by a live band. I'm embedding the concert below at her performance of Palette, but you know the drill. The whole concert is incredible:

As usual, it wouldn't be a celebration without merch. And Towa's illustrator rurudo-sensei drew some absolutely gorgeous art of Towa for this merch package. Here's what you can get:

- Full Voice Set
- B2-sized Tapestry illustrated by rurudo-sensei
- Bibi-themed plush cushion
- Towa-themed Key Holder
- Postcard illustrated by rurudo-sensei and signed in foil by Towa!

The full set is 11,000 JPY (about $102 USD) and the tapestry, Bibi plush, and key holder are all being sold separately as well.

## Super Nenechi 3D Debut!

Nene's 3D Debut was this weekend and it was pretty much everything you would expect from our adorable, diabetes-inducing ball of energy. Nene's energy is so uplifting and I loved every minute of this stream. Also, Nene's dancing was seriously impressive. She is quite possibly in the top 2 or 3 dancers in all of Hololive.

I'm embedding the stream below at her opening performance of her 1st original song, but at the end is the live debut of her new original song "Lunch with me" so be sure to check that out:

To celebrate Nene's 3D Debut, there's also some merch you can grab:

- 3D Model Acrylic Stand
- Nekko rubber strap and HAAAN felt badge

These are available as a set for 4000 JPY or 2000 JPY individually (about $37 or $19 USD).

## Okayu Sings to 1M Subscribers

On Saturday, Okayu was just around 5k subs away from 1M so she slotted an endurance karaoke stream in the two hours right between Towa and Calli's concerts. We got to experience about 5 hours of non-stop Hololive singing thanks to these three, but Okayu knocked those 5k subs out quick. She finished in less than 2 hours and was able to wrap up her stream before Calli started. I've embedded her stream below starting at her performance of LiSA's "Homura" from the new Demon Slayer movie. It's so good:

## Coco's Meme Review with Guest Korone

Coco had another Reddit Meme review this weekend, this time with special guest Korone! We got to find out about how Korone's abuse of her Koronesukis is consensual and hear a ton of really infectious doggo laughter. Check out the stream below:

## Kiara's HoloTalk with Suisei!

We got a new episode of HoloTalk this week with special guest: Sui-chan! A lot of what was covered in this episode isn't really new to Hoshiyomis, but Kiara did a fantastic job of introducing our comet to more overseas fans.

Suisei was cute, as always, and especially so during this interview because she started off kind of sleepy. Suisei isn't a morning person and the interview took place at 8 AM JST. Check out Kiara's stream below:
