<abbr title="Kon-nene! (Nene's greeting)">こんねね！</abbr>

It's a new week and this one is already starting off pretty busy. We've got some
new music to talk about, one of the Holostars boys hit Master rank in Apex on
stream, there a big (and hilarious) Among Us collab, and Roboco has returned
from her week off! Off we go.

## New Holo no Graffiti

A new week means a new episode of Holo no Graffiti, Hololive's weekly animation
series starring the girls. The localization team for HoloGra is excellent and
all of the episodes are captioned, so be sure to check out the others you may
have missed. I've embedded this week's episode below:

## New Music!

We've got a couple new tracks for your listening pleasure today. HoloID Gen 1's
Iofi has her first original which is a collaboration with Holostars Gen 1's
Rikka on lyrics and music. Check it out below:

We also have Temma from Holostars Gen 2 collaborating with Miyabi from Holostars
Gen 1 on a cover of Romeo. Check it out as well:

## Astel is an Apex Master

Astel Leda is officially the first Hololive-related talent to achieve the Apex
Master rank on-stream. I've tuned into a few of his Apex streams now and they've
been pretty entertaining. He also is pretty good at the game, as evidenced by
the new rank.

I've included the stream below, timestamped to the victory that led to his rank
promotion:

## Roboco is back!

Roboco is back from her week-long break and returned with a
[superchat reading stream][RoboSupas] and a
[Minecraft collab with AZKi][RoboAZMC]. The Minecraft collab also had a guest
appearance you don't want to miss. I love Roboco so it's good to see her back
and I love seeing AZKi more active and collaborating with the other girls.

## Among Us Collab

There was a big Hololive JP Among Us collab with Fubuki, Miko, Korone, Noel,
Coco, Marine, Kanata, Lamy, and Botan recently. The girls all had a ton of fun
and a lot of laughs were had, especially by Korone. That girl's hysterical laugh
is something else. Each girl streamed their own POV so you're able to see all
of the action. If you wanna view the VODs all together, head over to
[our resources page][TWIHLResources] and load up the VOD URLs into HoloTools so
that you can see all the action on one screen.

Here's a clip of one of my favorite and most hilarious parts of the Among Us
session:

## Flare Endurance Karaoke to 550k Subscribers

Flare held another endurance karaoke stream to hit a new milestone. That's it,
that's the story. I just love her voice. Go listen.

## Check out these clips

Here's a few fun clips that I enjoyed recently. If you're looking for more
clips, head on over to [our resources page][TWIHLResources] where you can find
a list of quality clippers. I've also started tagging some of these with the
talents that they commonly clip and will be filling out these tags more over
time.

## Wrapping Up

I'm not going to talk about it yet, but I've already seen something that's
coming this week that I am ***VERY*** excited about, so be on the lookout for
that. Tomorrow is the HoloArt Corner and our first special post for Suisei Week,
so come back to check those out!
