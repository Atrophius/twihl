Welcome to This Week in Hololive's Weekly Roundup where we attempt to summarize
a lot of the interesting happenings of the last week. This past week saw a lot
of interesting Hololive activity including a lot of music, a wild HoloEN UNO
collab, AZKi's non-stop music festival, and more! Let's get right to it!

## This Week's Articles

Almost every day, I post HoloDay articles recapping interesting things that
happened in the last couple days. We have three HoloDays from the last week that
I've linked below so that you can go check them out:

* [HoloDay #6][HoloDay6] - A new Holo no Graffiti, a big Among Us collab, new
music, Apex Master Astel, and Roboco is back!
* [HoloDay #7][HoloDay7] - Suisei and Fubuki celebrate milestones, Aki
celebrates her birthday, HoloEN has a wild UNO collab, and OH MY GOD THE MV FOR PALETTE IS INCREDIBLE.
* [HoloDay #8][HoloDay8] - AZKi's non-stop music festival, Cover gets permission
for Capcom games, Sora and Luna hit new milestones, and Suisei speedruns ...
stream scheduling?

In addition to HoloDays, we also have three other ongoing articles series:
**The HoloArt Corner**, **HoloHistory**, and **HoloMusic**. The HoloArt Corner
is a series dedicated to featuring the amazing artistic works of fans and
members of the Hololive community. HoloHistory is a look back into the origins
and early days of our favorite idols. HoloMusic debuted this week with the
release of Towa's Palette MV. You can check those out below as well:

* [HoloArt Corner #2][HoloArt2] - It's Week 2 of the HoloArt Corner and we're
featuring Fan Art of all of HoloEN plus Korone, Suisei, Shion, Mio, Towa,
and A-chan!
* [HoloHistory #1][HoloHistory1] - We're kicking off HoloHistory with a look
back on Suisei's early days and her very first original song, Comet.
* [HoloMusic #1][HoloMusic1] - On the inaugural edition of "HoloMusic", we're
taking a deep look at Towa's new MV for her first original song: Palette.

## World Wide Support for Haato Project

I wanted to take a moment at the beginning of this article to point you in the
direction of [@WWS_Haato](https://twitter.com/WWS_Haato) and the fan project
they're currently working on. As everyone knows, Haachama took a break at the
beginning of this month and said that she was going on a journey of
self-discovery.

The team behind WWS_Haato is trying to put together pictures from around the
world to give to Haachama as a sort of "world tour" guide in order to support
her. It's a lovely project and if you've got some place nearby that you'd like
to give Haachama a tour of, then check out the tweet below for the full details
on the project and submission instructions:

## Roboco's 3rd Anniversary Celebration

Roboco's 3rd Anniversary Celebration was this week. She did a 1 hour 3D Live
mini-concert where she performed a number of ballad-style songs. Roboco's
singing was absolutely beautiful during this event and I had an exceptionally
difficult time picking a song to showcase during today's post. I've embedded
the stream below timestamped to one of my favorite songs from her set but, as
usual, I highly recommend watching the entire thing:

Roboco also announced a new set of commemorative merch for her anniversary. The
merch includes:

* An acrylic block photo
* An acrylic key chain
* A set of commemorative voice packs

Buying the full set will also get you a post card with a foil stamped copy of
Roboco's autograph.

## AZKi 7th Live Announced

AZKi's "Don't Stop the Music" Festival is still ongoing for a while longer. It's
currently in the 3rd and final day. At the end of Day 1, AZKi held a special
solo live where she sang a number of songs from other artists that were being
featured throughout the weekend. The archive isn't available yet but will be up
over on [AZKi's Channel][AZKiChannel] not long after the full event is over, so
be on the lookout for that.

During her solo live, she announced her upcoming 7th concert titled "Stand at
the crossroads"! It looks like this will be a free event happening on her
channel. You can see the promo image below and I've also embedded the ongoing
Day 3 of "Don't Stop the Music" which you can check out below:

## Subaru Makes Her Pro-Wrestling Debut?

A hilarious story came about this week when New Japan Pro Wrestling star
"Great-O-Khan" performed a move during a show that he named after Subaru. It's
the "Oozora Subaru Neck & Backbreaker" and it looks awfully similar to a move
Subaru used on Watame in an episode of HoloGra earlier this year. I've embedded
a clip of Subaru's reaction to the tweet as well as the original tweet below.
You can also
[go check out the episode of HoloGra the move came from][HoloGraCoffee].

## Mio's Sentimental Plate

Everyone's favorite adorable wolf mom had a bit of a rough week. Earlier in the
week, she tweeted out that she was feeling a little depressed an didn't feel
like she could stream so she was taking a day off. This worried a lot her fans
who thought it might be something really serious, but it turns out that Mio was
feeling down for more sentimental reasons because a plate that was very special
to her from her childhood had broken.

As a wholesome turn to this story, Korone and Okayu saw that Mio was feeling
down and reached out to her to make sure everything was okay, cheering her up
a bit. Fubuki and Ayame also reached out to show their support. I always love
seeing the Hololive family supporting each other, even through seemingly mundane
issues such as this.

I've embedded a clip of Mio's explanation of what happened below:

## New IDOL PROJECT Radio Show Announced

Over on the same station that hosts Suisei's Music Space program, Hololive is
about to debut a new radio show dedicated to showcasing the talents in the IDOL
PROJECT. A-chan will be hosting along with a rotating cast of talents, starting
with Fubuki and Aqua on April 4th and 11th.

## Coco's Meme Review with Okayu

Okayu was this week's guest on Coco's meme review! There were some really great
moments in here, including Okayu learning the meaning of Marine's favorite
phrase, Coco's maybe not completely accurate understanding of the word "waifu",
more smug Okayu, and more!

Resident Okayu watcher [Jin Teramachi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvfBcwJvQKu2RJKSUocuseg)
put together a nice highlight video with translations which I've embedded below:

Here's a few of my favorite fan arts from the past week or so. I've embedded the
original tweets for all of these below. Go show these artists some love.
