Welcome to HoloDay #21! We're gearing up for a packed weekend that's going to
include a ton of really awesome stuff like Towa's Anniversary Concert and
Calli's EP Release Concert. Today's a little bit of a light day, but the Weekly
Roundup is going to be great. You definitely don't want to miss it.

# Ina Invited to pixiv / Wacom "Drawfest" Event

As part of Ina's birthday celebrations next month, she's going to be participating in pixiv's online drawing festival on May 23rd. pixiv interviewed her papa, Kuroboshi-sensei, and received notes on how to draw Ina. Ina and the audience will receive these notes and use them to all draw her together. It should be a good time. Check out Ina's reaction to the announcement below:

## Sora's Minecraft Karaoke Concert

Sora did a Minecraft stream this week where she did some singing while making it look like her Minecraft character was performing, complete with cute camera control and everything. She also had a surprise guest when Miko showed up for the end of her concert to cheer her on in-game. The interaction was really sweet and I'm embedding her stream below at the last song which is where Miko showed up:

## Perfectly Persistent Tenshi Clears Another Frustrating Game

Hot off the heels of her extremely long time spent on the Sans fight in Undertale, Kanata decided to give another frustrating game a go. This time, it was Jump King. Thankfully, she didn't spend near as much time on this game as she did Undertale with just under 33 hours spent on Jump King.

Her final stats for the game:

- 32 hours and 46 minutes played
- 32,725 jumps
- 3,269 falls

I've embedded her final stream of the game below at the last few jumps before her victory. Her joy at finishing the game is so pure:

## Another Mio Ukulele Stream

I'm pretty much going to include every Mio ukulele stream because I love these so much. They're so relaxing and Mio's voice is absolutely beautiful. Today's was special because she did an a capella version of Sparkle which was lovely. I've embedded stream below at Sparkle:

## Last Call for AZKi's 7th Live

Wanted to take a quick second to remind you that AZKi's 7th Live "Stand at the crossroads" is only available for free on her channel for a couple more days. If you haven't taken some time to watch it yet, this is your last chance before it goes members-only this weekend. I've embedded the concert stream again below, this time starting at "Fake.Fake.Fake" which is another one of my favorites in AZKi's original library:
