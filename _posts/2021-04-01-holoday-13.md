Welcome to HoloDay #13! It's April Fool's Day and there has been quite a lot of
wild and fun pranks happening all throughout Hololive. There's actually been so
many that I can't include them all in one post, so we're going to split them
between today and tomorrow's HoloDays. Here we go!

## Pekora in Prison

Over on Pekora's channel, a video premiered which started like a Pekora-themed
rip off of the AsaCoco news show called "PekoNews" before it was quickly
interrupted and Pekora was seemingly hauled off by police. Right after that,
Coco appeared and took over with an impromptu AsaCoco news coverage of Pekora's
arrest including interviews with Rushia, Moona, Sora, and Okayu.

Amazingly, as this video was premiering Coco was also doing a chatting stream
and actually disappeared briefly from her own stream while this was going on to
give the illusion that she moved over to Pekora's stream to host the news live.
The whole thing was really quite brilliant and ended in what appeared to be a
teaser for a new outfit for Pekora. I've embedded the video below:

In the morning after this happened, Pekora did an emergency broadcast from
prison where she did indeed reveal a new outfit. Her prison stripes. She also
did some calls with other HoloMembers: Noel, Botan, Watame, and Mio. Here's a
screenshot of her new outfit from the stream and I've also embedded the stream
below:

## The Great Genderbendening?

**Several** members of Hololive did gender swaps for April Fool's Day, including
the _entirety_ of HoloID and a few members of Holostars. Aki also jumped in on
the action with her swap to the incredible "Mukirose":

Suisei and Flare also swapped their Twitter profile appearances to that of their
"Hoshimachi Meteor" and "Shiranui Homura" male personas based on some fan art
from some time back:

## Hololive Gamers' New Look

Hololive released a video to their main channel which shows off some really
significant upgrades that have been made to the appearance of the Hololive
Gamers unit. Fubuki, Korone, Okayu, and Mio all have much more detailed and
realistic appearances as you'll be able to see from the video below:

## Matsuri, but 5 years old

While a lot of the rest of the Hololive crew was genderbending for April Fool's
Day, Matsuri spent the day as little Matsuri. She updated her Twitter profile to
her younger self and did a short karaoke stream over on her channel as little
Matsuri where she sang some songs in a child-like voice. You can find that
stream below:

## HoloMyth New Outfits

Over on the English side of things, the Hololive English girls all revealed a
brand new set of outfits for the whole crew. These models are inspired from
some fan art you may be familiar with. Take a look:

In addition to the new outfits, the girls also played Jackbox with audience
participation. As is normally the case when all of them gather, this stream was
hilarious and a ton of fun to watch. You can tell that all of them were having
a great time.
