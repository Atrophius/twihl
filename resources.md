## Viewing Resources

### [Holodex](https://holodex.net/)

Holodex is a massive content aggregation site that pulls in all of the active,
upcoming, and previous streams of the talents as well as clips from their
tracked list of clippers/subbers. They also track music produced by the talents
using a crowdsourced song curation that allows users to submit timestamps for
songs in karaoke streams that go into a searchable database, in addition to the
official videos for covers and originals. Add on top of that the ability to
multi-stream several of your favorite talents at once, chat-sourced translations
built directly into the site, and their creative "MugenClips" feature which
allows for group watching of an endlist list of clips. This is an incredible
resource for consuming your favorite Hololive content.

### [HoloTools](https://hololive.jetri.co/#/)

HoloTools is a multi-stream website that also lists upcoming and historical
streams for all of the Hololive talents. You can use it to keep track of all
your favorite talents and watch multiple streams simultaneously really easily.
The best part is that LiveTL (below) works with HoloTools so you can inline
expand a LiveTL panel for every stream you have open once you've loaded the
chat!

### [LiveTL](https://livetl.app/)

LiveTL is a browser extension that you can install to make it easier to follow
Japanese-language streams. LiveTL reads the live chat looking for users that
are posting translations using a specific format and filters them out into
their own chat pane to make it easier to follow what's happening in the stream.

LiveTL depends on active live translators being in the chat, so please show them
some love. I very much appreciate the time and effort that these folks
dedicate to improving our overseas viewing experience.

### Fan Translators / Clippers

One of the best ways to keep up with the Hololive talents is through fan
translations and clips. I've compiled a list of pretty well-respected
translators and clippers below. If you see a mistake or anyone I missed or think
I should add, [hit me up on Twitter][TWIHLTwitter].
