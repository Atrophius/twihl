## Viewing Resources

### [HoloTools](https://hololive.jetri.co/#/)

HoloTools is a mulit-stream website that also lists upcoming and historical
streams for all of the Hololive talents. You can use it to keep track of all
your favorite talents and watch multiple streams simultaneously really easily.
The best part is that LiveTL (below) works with HoloTools so you can inline
expand a LiveTL panel for every stream you have open once you've loaded the
chat!

### [LiveTL](https://kentonishi.github.io/LiveTL/)

LiveTL is a browser extension that you can install to make it easier to follow
Japanese-language streams. LiveTL reads the live chat looking for users that
are posting translations using a specific format and filters them out into
their own chat pane to make it easier to follow what's happening in the stream.

LiveTL depends on active live translators being in the chat, so please show them
some love. I very much appreciate the time and effort that these folks
dedicate to improving our overseas viewing experience.
