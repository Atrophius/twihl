*Adapted from the Hololive explanations from Reddit that are frequently posted
when subreddit posts reach /r/all.*

Hello! This is a website recapping recent events for Hololive Production
([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hololive_Production)), a talent
agency based out of Tokyo, Japan that manages Virtual YouTubers - content
creators who stream using digital avatars. Let's start by providing some answers
to commonly asked questions.

## Why digital?

Various reasons. It's fun, it's unique, and it provides a degree of anonymity.
It's also a showcase of how technology has advanced over recent years. The idea
of being a cartoon character in real-time was essentially unheard of even five
years ago.

## So they're cartoons? This is kiddie stuff then?

Like with other content creators, our content appeals to all. Some talents
provide fairly family friendly content, others provide more risque content. Just
because we use digital avatars, does not mean we're catering to children.

## Then, they're just a bunch of guys with voice changers?

No. Hololive talents are all female. Holostars (an off-shoot group under the
same "Hololive Production" umbrella) talents are all male.

## Why is this so popular?

Content creators are popular. How often do people watch someone regularly on
YouTube or Twitch? The same thing applies here. Different people like different
things.

## All right. Sell me on the idea then.

Depends what you're looking for.
