Hello and welcome to This Week in Hololive! This is a passion project by a
Hololive Super Fan who just wants to share his love for Hololive with the world.
On this site, you're primarily going to find frequent (roughly daily) roundups
of interesting stuff that's happening all across Hololive, including all of the
Japanese Generations, HoloMyth/HoloEN, and HoloID. There's a LOT of content out
there related to Hololive and I'm already looking through a lot of it, so if you
feel like you're having a hard time keeping up then this is the place for you.

Like most of you, I have my personal favorites which you'll likely see more
content of on this website. I love and enjoy watching all of the girls, but
here's a list of my oshis so you know what you're getting into:

* JP Gen 0
    * Tokino Sora
    * Robocosan
    * Hoshimachi Suisei
* JP Gen 1
    * Natsuiro Matsuri
    * Aki Rosenthal
    * Akai Haato (HAACHAMA)
* JP Gen 2
    * **Oozora Subaru**
* JP Gamers
    * Nekomata Okayu
    * Inugami Korone
    * Ookami Mio
* JP Gen 3
    * Shirogane Noel
    * Shiranui Flare
    * Hoshou Marine
* JP Gen 4
    * Kiryu Coco
    * Amane Kanata
    * Tokoyami Towa
* JP Gen 5
    * Shishiro Botan
    * Momosuzu Nene
* HoloMyth / HoloEN
    * **Ninomae Ina'nis**
    * Mori Calliope
* ID Gen 1
    * Airani Iofifteen
    * Moona Hoshinova
* ID Gen 2
    * Pavolia Reine

I am, in particular, a HUGE fan of the musicians within Hololive and you will
likely see coverage of just about everything music-related. I've previously
live tweeted both 2nd Fes / Bloom and will likely do something similar for any
other big Hololive musical events in the future. I will particularly gush about
pretty much anything music-related that comes out of **Suisei, Towa, Calli,
Kanata, and Sora**.

I think that about covers it. I look forward to helping people stay in the loop
on what's going on. If you want to get in touch with me, you can follow this
site on Twitter [@WeekInHololive](https://twitter.com/WeekInHololive). I'm also
making the following e-mail addresses available for people who want to help me
