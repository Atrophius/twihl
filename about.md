Hello and welcome to This Week in Hololive! This is a passion project by a
Hololive Super Fan who just wants to share his love for Hololive with the world.
On this site, you're primarily going to find frequent (roughly daily) roundups
of interesting stuff that's happening all across Hololive, including all of the
Japanese Generations, HoloMyth/HoloEN, and HoloID. There's a LOT of content out
there related to Hololive and I'm already looking through a lot of it, so if you
feel like you're having a hard time keeping up then this is the place for you.

Here's what you can expect to start happening here over the next couple months:

* **HoloDay and Weekly Roundups** &mdash; I'm going to have small bursts of
information coming out on a very frequent basis as interesting things happen
with all of the talents. Those will be HoloDay posts. The Weekly Roundups are
designed as an "In Case You Missed It" drop of information from the HoloDays for
the past week + stuff I couldn't include in individual HoloDays, some additional
information on talent milestones, some interesting content you might have
missed, and some of my favorite fan art from the past week. Soon, you'll be able
to subscribe to our Weekly Roundups via email to make sure you never miss an update.
* **Talent Profiles** &mdash; I'm planning to write up profiles of the talents
that will be eventually used as a hub on this site for all things related to
that talent. Each talent will start with a basic profile with resources, recent
news and activities related to that talent, etc. Eventually, the goal is to have
a detailed breakdown of each talent's background and history within Hololive so
people new to the community can learn much more about their oshis in one place
instead of little bits of information spread out in several places across the
internet.
* **HoloMusic Series** &mdash; I **LOVE** the musical talent within Hololive. It
is by far some of my favorite content and we will be giving special attention to
both past and future original music as well as covers that come from the
Hololive talents.
* **HoloArt Corner** &mdash; Hololive boasts one of the most talented and
creative fanbases I've personally ever seen and I want to take some time on a
regular basis to highlight fanworks that have been created to honor the talents.

Like most of you, I have my personal favorites which you'll likely see more
content of on this website. I love and enjoy watching all of the girls, but
here's a list of my oshis so you know what you're getting into:

* JP Gen 0
    * Tokino Sora
    * Robocosan
    * Hoshimachi Suisei
* JP Gen 1
    * Natsuiro Matsuri

    * Akai Haato (HAACHAMA)

I am, in particular, a HUGE fan of the musicians within Hololive and you will
likely see coverage of just about everything music-related. I've previously
live tweeted both 2nd Fes / Bloom and will likely do something similar for any
other big Hololive musical events in the future. I will particularly gush about
pretty much anything music-related that comes out of **Suisei, Towa, Calli,
Kanata, and Sora**.

I think that about covers it. I look forward to helping people stay in the loop
on what's going on. If you want to get in touch with me, you can follow this
